.Sh DESCRIPTION
.
.Bd -filled -compact -offset indent
.Sy Compatibility note:
S-nail (\*(UA) will wrap up into \%S-mailx in v15.0 (circa 2020).
Backward incompatibility has to be expected \(en
.Sx COMMANDS
will use
.Sx "Shell-style argument quoting"
rules, for example, and shell metacharacters will become meaningful.
Many old-style commands accept new syntax via
.Cm wysh ,
one of the
.Sx "Command modifiers" .
New and old behaviour is flagged \*(IN and \*(OU, and setting
.Va v15-compat ,
one of the many
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES" ,
will choose new behaviour when applicable; when set with value,
.Cm wysh
is default behaviour.
\*(OB flags what will vanish, and enabling
.Fl d
or
.Fl v
enables obsoletion warnings.
.Ed
.
.Pp
\*(UA provides a simple and friendly environment for sending and
receiving mail.
It is intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX
.Xr mailx 1
command, but is MIME capable and optionally offers extensions for
line editing, S/MIME, SMTP and POP3, among others.
\*(UA divides incoming mail into its constituent messages and allows
the user to deal with them in any order.
It offers many
.Sx COMMANDS
and
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
for manipulating messages and sending mail.
It provides the user simple editing capabilities to ease the composition
of outgoing messages, and increasingly powerful and reliable
non-interactive scripting capabilities.
.
.\" .Ss "Options" {{{
.Ss "Options"
.
.Bl -tag -width ".It Fl BaNg"
.Mx
.It Fl \&: Ar spec , Fl Fl resource-files Ns =..
Explicitly control which of the
.Sx "Resource files"
shall be
.Ic source Ns
d (loaded): if the letter
.Ql s
is (case-insensitively) part of the
.Ar spec
then the system wide
.Pa \*(UR
is sourced, likewise the letter
.Ql u
controls sourcing of the user's personal
.Pa \*(ur
file, whereas the letters
.Ql -
and
.Ql /
explicitly forbid sourcing of any resource files.
Scripts should use this option: to avoid environmental noise they should
.Dq detach
from any configuration and create a script-specific environment, setting
any of the desired
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
via
.Fl S
and running configurating commands via
.Fl X .
This option overrides
.Fl n .
.
.Mx
.It Fl A Ar name , Fl Fl account Ns =..
Executes an
.Ic account
command for the given user email account
.Ar name
after program startup is complete (all resource files are loaded, any
.Fl S
setting is being established, but
.Fl X
commands have not been evaluated yet).
Being a special incarnation of
.Ic define Ns d
macros for the purpose of bundling longer-lived
.Ic set Ns
tings, activating such an email account also switches to the accounts
.Mx -sx
.Sx "primary system mailbox"
(most likely the
.Va inbox ) .
If the operation fails the program will exit if it is used
non-interactively, or if any of
.Va errexit
or
.Va posix
are set.
.
.Mx
.It Fl a Ar file Ns Oo Ar =input-charset Ns Oo Ar #output-charset Oc Oc , \
  Fl Fl attach Ns =..
Attach
.Ar file
to the message (for compose mode opportunities refer to
.Ic ~@
and
.Ic ~^ ) .
.Sx "Filename transformations"
(also see
.Ic file )
will be performed, except that shell variables are not expanded.
Shall
.Ar file
not be accessible but contain a
.Ql =
character, then anything before the last
.Ql =
will be used as the filename, anything thereafter as a character set
specification.
.Pp
If an input character set is specified,
.Mx -ix "character set specification"
but no output character set, then the given input character set is fixed
as-is, and no conversion will be applied;
giving the empty string or the special string hyphen-minus
.Ql -
will be treated as if
.Va ttycharset
has been specified (the default).
.Pp
If an output character set has also been given then the conversion will
be performed exactly as specified and on-the-fly, not considering the
file type and content.
As an exception the empty string or hyphen-minus
.Ql - ,
select the default conversion algorithm (see
.Sx "Character sets" ) :
no conversion is performed on-the-fly,
.Ar file
and its contents will be MIME-classified
.Pf ( Sx "HTML mail and MIME attachments" , "The mime.types files") ;
Only this mode is supported without support for character set conversions
.Pf ( Va features
does not mention
.Ql +iconv ) .
.
.It Fl B
(\*(OB: \*(UA will always use line-buffered output, to gain
line-buffered input even in batch mode enable batch mode via
.Fl # . )
.
.Mx
.It Fl b Ar addr , Fl Fl bcc Ns =..
Send blind carbon copies to (the list of recipients given in)
.Ar addr ,
if the
.Ic set Ns
ting of
.Va expandaddr ,
one of the
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES" ,
allows (for each recipient, individually); the
.Ql shquote
.Va expandaddr
flag is supported.
The option may be used multiple times.
Also see the section
.Sx "On sending mail, and non-interactive mode" .
.
.Mx
.It Fl C Ar """field: body""" , Fl Fl custom-header Ns =..
Create a custom header which persists for an entire session.
A custom header consists of the field name followed by a colon
.Ql \&:
and the field content body, e.g.,
.Ql -C """Blah: Neminem laede; imo omnes, quantum potes, juva""" .
Standard header field names cannot be overwritten by custom headers.
Runtime adjustable custom headers are available via the variable
.Va customhdr ,
and in compose mode
.Ic ~^ ,
one of the
.Sx "COMMAND ESCAPES" ,
as well as
.Ic digmsg
are the most flexible and powerful options to manage message headers.
This option may be used multiple times.
.
.Mx
.It Fl c Ar addr , Fl Fl cc Ns =..
Just like
.Fl b ,
except it places the argument in the list of carbon copies.
.
.Mx
.It Fl D , Fl Fl disconnected
(\*(OP) Startup with
.Va disconnected
.Ic set .
.
.Mx
.It Fl d , Fl Fl debug
Almost enable a sandbox mode with the internal variable
.Va debug ;
the same can be achieved via
.Ql Fl S Va \&\&debug
or
.Ql Ic set Va \&\&debug .
.
.Mx
.It Fl E , Fl Fl discard-empty-messages
.Ic set
.Va skipemptybody
and thus discard messages with an empty message part body.
.
.Mx
.It Fl e , Fl Fl check-and-exit
Just check if mail is present (in the system
.Va inbox
or the one specified via
.Fl f ) :
if yes, return an exit status of zero, a non-zero value otherwise.
To restrict the set of mails to consider in this evaluation a message
specification can be added with the option
.Fl L .
.
.Mx
.It Fl F
Save the message to send in a file named after the local part of the
first recipient's address (instead of in
.Va record Ns ).
.
.Mx
.It Fl f , Fl Fl file
Read in the contents of the user's
.Mx -sx
.Sx "secondary mailbox"
.Ev MBOX
(or the specified file) for processing;
when \*(UA is quit, it writes undeleted messages back to this file
(but be aware of the
.Va hold
option).
The optional
.Ar file
argument will undergo some special
.Sx "Filename transformations"
(as via
.Ic file ) .
Note that
.Ar file
is not an argument to the flag
.Fl \&\&f ,
but is instead taken from the command line after option processing has
been completed.
In order to use a
.Ar file
that starts with a hyphen-minus, prefix with a relative path, as in
.Ql ./-hyphenbox.mbox .
.
.Mx
.It Fl H , Fl Fl header-summary
Display a summary of
.Ic headers
for the given
.Ic file
(depending on
.Fl u ,
.Va inbox
or
.Ev MAIL ,
or as specified via
.Fl f ) .
A configurable summary view is available via the option
.Fl L .
This mode does not honour
.Va showlast .
.
.Mx
.It Fl h , Fl Fl help
Show a brief usage summary; use
.Fl Fl long-help
for a list long options.
.
.Mx
.It Fl i
.Ic set
.Va ignore
to ignore tty interrupt signals.
.
.Mx
.It Fl L Ar spec , Fl Fl header-search Ns =..
Display a summary of
.Ic headers
of all messages that match the given
.Ar spec
in the
.Ic file
found by the same algorithm used by
.Fl H ,
then exit.
See the section
.Sx "Specifying messages"
for the format of
.Ar spec .
This mode does not honour
.Va showlast .
.Pp
If the
.Fl e
option has been given in addition no header summary is produced,
but \*(UA will instead indicate via its exit status whether
.Ar spec
matched any messages
.Pf ( Ql 0 )
or not
.Pf ( Ql 1 ) ;
note that any verbose output is suppressed in this mode and must instead
be enabled explicitly (e.g., by using the option
.Fl v ) .
.
.Mx
.It Fl M Ar type
Special send mode that will flag standard input with the MIME
.Ql Content-Type:
set to the given known
.Ar type
.Pf ( Sx "HTML mail and MIME attachments" , "The mime.types files" )
and use it as the main message body.
\*(ID Using this option will bypass processing of
.Va message-inject-head
and
.Va message-inject-tail .
Also see
.Fl q , m , t .
.
.Mx
.It Fl m Ar file
Special send mode that will MIME classify the specified
.Ar file ,
and use it as the main message body.
\*(ID Using this option will bypass processing of
.Va message-inject-head
and
.Va message-inject-tail .
Also see
.Fl q , M , t .
.
.Mx
.It Fl N , Fl Fl no-header-summary
inhibit the initial display of message headers when reading mail or
editing a mailbox
.Ic folder
by calling
.Ic unset
for the internal variable
.Va header .
.
.Mx
.It Fl n
Standard flag that inhibits reading the system wide
.Pa \*(UR
upon startup.
The option
.Fl \&:
allows more control over the startup sequence; also see
.Sx "Resource files" .
.
.Mx
.It Fl q Ar file , Fl Fl quote-file Ns =..
Special send mode that will initialize the message body with the
contents of the specified
.Ar file ,
which may be standard input
.Ql -
only in non-interactive context.
Also see
.Fl M , m , t .
.
.Mx
.It Fl R , Fl Fl read-only
Any mailbox
.Ic folder
a.k.a.\&
.Ic file
opened will be in read-only mode.
.
.
.Mx
.It Fl r Ar from-addr , Fl Fl from-address Ns =..
Whereas the source address that appears in the
.Va from
header of a message (or in the
.Va sender
header if the former contains multiple addresses) is honoured by the
built-in SMTP transport, it is not used by a file-based
.Va mta
(Mail-Transfer-Agent) for the RFC 5321 reverse-path used for relaying
and delegating a message to its destination(s), for delivery errors
etc., but it instead uses the local identity of the initiating user.
.
.Pp
When this command line option is used the given single addressee
.Ar from-addr
will be assigned to the internal variable
.Va from ,
but in addition the command line option
.Fl \&\&f Ar from-addr
will be passed to a file-based
.Va mta
whenever a message is sent.
Shall
.Ar from-addr
include a user name the address components will be separated and
the name part will be passed to a file-based
.Va mta
individually via
.Fl \&\&F Ar name .
.
.Pp
If an empty string is passed as
.Ar from-addr
then the content of the variable
.Va from
(or, if that contains multiple addresses,
.Va sender )
will be evaluated and used for this purpose whenever the file-based
.Va mta
is contacted.
By default, without
.Fl \&\&r
that is, neither
.Fl \&\&f
nor
.Fl \&\&F
command line options are used when contacting a file-based MTA, unless
this automatic deduction is enforced by
.Ic set Ns
ing the internal variable
.Va r-option-implicit .
.
.Pp
Remarks: many default installations and sites disallow overriding the
local user identity like this unless either the MTA has been configured
accordingly or the user is member of a group with special privileges.
Passing an invalid address will cause an error.
.
.
.Mx
.It Fl S Ar var Ns Oo = Ns value Oc , Fl Fl set Ns =..
.Ic set
(or, with a prefix string
.Ql no ,
as documented in
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES" ,
.Ic unset )
.Ar var Ns
iable and optionally assign
.Ar value ,
if supported; \*(ID the entire expression is evaluated as if specified
within dollar-single-quotes (see
.Sx "Shell-style argument quoting" )
if the internal variable
.Va v15-compat
is set.
If the operation fails the program will exit if any of
.Va errexit
or
.Va posix
are set.
Settings established via
.Fl \&\&S
cannot be changed from within
.Sx "Resource files"
or an account switch initiated by
.Fl A .
They will become mutable again before commands registered via
.Fl X
are executed.
.
.Mx
.It Fl s Ar subject , Fl Fl subject Ns =..
Specify the subject of the message to be sent.
Newline (NL) and carriage-return (CR) bytes are invalid and will be
normalized to space (SP) characters.
.
.Mx
.It Fl T Ar """field: addr""" , Fl Fl target Ns =..
Add
.Ar addr ,
interpreted as a single addressee, to the list of receivers targeted by
.Ar field ,
for now supported are only
.Ql bcc ,
.Ql cc ,
.Ql fcc ,
and
.Ql to .
Field and body (address) are separated by a colon
.Ql \&:
and/or blank (space, tabulator) characters.
The
.Ql shquote
.Va expandaddr
flag is supported.
Via the question mark
.Ql \&?
modifier suffix the
.Fl b , c
etc. list parse mode is available, the keyword
.Ql list
is optional, e.g.,
.Ql to? ,
.Ql to?: ,
.Ql to?list
etc. are identical.
This option may be used multiple times.
.
.Mx
.It Fl t , Fl Fl template
The message given (on standard input) is expected to contain, separated
from the message body by an empty line, one or multiple message headers.
Headers can span multiple consecutive lines if follow lines start with
any amount of whitespace.
A line starting with the number sign
.Ql #
in the first column is ignored.
Message recipients can be given via the message headers
.Ql To: ,
.Ql Cc: ,
.Ql Bcc:
or
.Ql Fcc: ,
they will be added to any recipients specified on the command line,
and are likewise subject to
.Va expandaddr
validity checks.
If a message subject is specified via
.Ql Subject:
then it will be used in favour of one given on the command line.
.Pp
More optional headers are
.Ql Reply-To:
(possibly overriding
.Va reply-to ) ,
.Ql Sender:
.Pf ( Va sender ) ,
.Ql From:
.Pf ( Va from
and / or option
.Fl r ) .
.Ql Message-ID: ,
.Ql In-Reply-To: ,
.Ql References:
and
.Ql Mail-Followup-To: ,
by default created automatically dependent on message context, will
be used if specified (a special address massage will however still occur
for the latter).
Any other custom header field (also see
.Fl C ,
.Va customhdr
and
.Ic ~^ )
is passed through entirely
unchanged, and in conjunction with the options
.Fl ~
or
.Fl #
it is possible to embed
.Sx "COMMAND ESCAPES" .
Also see
.Fl M , m , q .
.
.Mx
.It Fl u Ar user , Fl Fl inbox-of Ns =..
Initially read the
.Mx -sx
.Sx "primary system mailbox"
of
.Ar user ,
appropriate privileges presumed; effectively identical to
.Ql Fl \&\&f Ns \0%user .
.
.Mx
.It Fl V , Fl Fl version
Show \*(UAs
.Va version
and exit.
The command
.Ic version
will also show the list of
.Va features :
.Ql $ \*(uA -Xversion -Xx .
.
.Mx
.It Fl v , Fl Fl verbose
.Ic set Ns
ting the internal variable
.Va verbose
enables display of some informational context messages.
Using it twice increases the level of verbosity.
.
.Mx
.It Fl X Ar cmd , Fl Fl early-cmd Ns =..
Add the given (or multiple for a multiline argument)
.Ar cmd
to a list of commands to be executed before normal operation starts.
The commands will be evaluated as a unit, just as via
.Ic source .
Correlates with
.Fl #
and
.Va errexit .
.
.Mx
.It Fl Y Ar cmd , Fl Fl cmd Ns =..
Add the given (or multiple for a multiline argument)
.Ar cmd
to a list of commands to be executed after normal operation has started.
The commands will be evaluated successively in the given order, and as
if given on the program's standard input.
In conjunction with
.Fl t
they will be evaluated after the template mail has been fully read.
.
.Mx
.It Fl ~ , Fl Fl enable-cmd-escapes
Enable
.Sx "COMMAND ESCAPES"
in compose mode even in non-interactive use cases.
This can be used to, e.g., automatically format the composed message
text before sending the message:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ( echo 'line    one. Word.     Word2.';\e
    echo '~| /usr/bin/fmt -tuw66' ) |\e
  LC_ALL=C \*(uA -d~:/ -Sttycharset=utf-8 bob@exam.ple
.Ed
.
.Mx
.It Fl # , Fl Fl batch-mode
Enables batch mode: standard input is made line buffered, the complete
set of (interactive) commands is available, processing of
.Sx "COMMAND ESCAPES"
is enabled in compose mode, and diverse
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
are adjusted for batch necessities, exactly as if done via
.Ic set :
.Va emptystart ,
.Pf no Va errexit ,
.Pf no Va header ,
.Pf no Va posix ,
.Va quiet ,
.Va sendwait ,
.Va typescript-mode
as well as
.Ev MAIL ,
.Ev MBOX
and
.Va inbox
(the latter three to
.Pa /dev/null ) .
Also, the values of
.Ev COLUMNS
and
.Ev LINES
are looked up, and acted upon.
The following prepares an email message in a batched dry run:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ LC_ALL=C printf 'm bob\en~s ubject\enText\en~.\enx\en' |\e
  LC_ALL=C \*(uA -d#:/ -X'alias bob bob@exam.ple'
.Ed
.
.Mx
.It Fl \&. , Fl Fl end-options
This flag forces termination of option processing in order to prevent
.Dq option injection
(attacks).
It also forcefully puts \*(UA into send mode, see
.Sx "On sending mail, and non-interactive mode" .
.El
.
.Pp
All given
.Ar to-addr
arguments and all receivers established via
.Fl b
and
.Fl c
as well as
.Fl T
are subject to the checks established by
.Va expandaddr ,
one of the
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES" ;
they all support the flag
.Ql shquote .
If the setting of
.Va expandargv
allows their recognition all
.Ar mta-option
arguments given at the end of the command line after a
.Ql --
separator will be passed through to a file-based
.Va mta
(Mail-Transfer-Agent) and persist for the entire session.
.Va expandargv
constraints do not apply to the content of
.Va mta-arguments .

\*(UA is a direct descendant of
.Bx
Mail, itself a successor to the Research
.Ux
mail which
.Dq was there from the start
according to
.Sx HISTORY .
It thus represents the user side of the
.Ux
mail system, whereas the system side (Mail-Transfer-Agent, MTA) was
traditionally taken by
.Xr sendmail 8 ,
and most MTAs provide a binary of this name for compatibility purposes.
If the \*(OPal SMTP
.Va mta
is included in the
.Va features
of \*(UA then the system side is not a mandatory precondition for mail
delivery.
.
.Pp
Because \*(UA strives for compliance with POSIX
.Xr mailx 1
it is likely that some configuration settings have to be adjusted before
using it is a smooth experience.
(Rather complete configuration examples can be found in the section
.Sx EXAMPLES . )
The provided global
.Pa \*(UR
(one of the
.Sx "Resource files" )
template bends those standard imposed settings of the
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
a bit towards more user friendliness and safety, however.
.
.Pp
For example, it
.Ic set Ns s
.Va hold
and
.Va keepsave
in order to suppress the automatic moving of messages to the
.Mx -sx
.Sx "secondary mailbox"
.Ev MBOX
that would otherwise occur (see
.Sx "Message states" ) ,
and
.Va keep
to not remove empty system MBOX mailbox files (or all empty such files if
.Va posix
.Pf a.k.a.\0 Ev POSIXLY_CORRECT
mode has been enabled) to avoid mangling of file permissions when files
eventually get recreated.
.Pp
It also enables
.Va sendwait
in order to synchronize \*(UA with the exit status report of the used
.Va mta
when sending mails.
It
.Ic set Ns
s
.Va emptystart
to enter interactive startup even if the initial mailbox is empty,
.Va editheaders
to allow editing of headers as well as
.Va fullnames
to not strip down addresses in compose mode, and
.Va quote
to include the message that is being responded to when
.Ic reply Ns
ing, which is indented by an
.Va indentprefix
that also deviates from standard imposed settings.
.Va mime-counter-evidence
is fully enabled, too.
.
.Pp
Some random remarks.
The file mode creation mask can be managed explicitly via the variable
.Va umask .
Files and shell pipe output can be

.Sx "Resource files" .

To send a message to one or more people, using a local or built-in
.Va mta
(Mail-Transfer-Agent) transport to actually deliver the generated mail
message, \*(UA can be invoked with arguments which are the names of
people to whom the mail will be sent, and the command line options
.Fl b
and
.Fl c
can be used to add (blind) carbon copy receivers:

.Pp
If standard input is a terminal rather than the message to be sent,
the user is expected to type in the message contents.
In this compose mode \*(UA treats lines beginning with the character
.Ql ~
special \(en these are so-called
.Sx "COMMAND ESCAPES" ,
which can be used to read in files, process shell commands, add and edit
attachments and more; e.g.,
.Ic ~v
or
.Ic ~e
will start the
.Ev VISUAL
text
.Ev EDITOR ,
respectively, to revise the message in its current state,
.Ic ~h
allows editing of the most important message headers, with the potent
.Ic ~^
custom headers can be created, for example (more specifically than with
.Fl C
and
.Va customhdr ) .
\*(OPally
.Ic ~?
gives an overview of most other available command escapes.
.
.Pp
The command escape
.Ic ~.
(see there) will call hooks, insert automatic injections and receivers,
leave compose mode and send the message once it is completed.
Aborting letter composition is possible with either of
.Ic ~x
or
.Ic ~q ,
the latter of which will save the message in the file denoted by
.Ev DEAD
unless
.Pf no Va save
is set.
And unless
.Va ignoreeof
is set the effect of
.Ic ~.
can also be achieved by typing end-of-transmission (EOT) via
.Ql control-D
.Pf ( Ql ^D )
at the beginning of an empty line, and
.Ic ~q
is always reachable by typing end-of-text (ETX) twice via
.Ql control-C
.Pf ( Ql ^C ) .
.
.Pp
A number of
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
and
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
can be used to alter default behavior.
E.g., messages are sent asynchronously, without supervision, unless the
internal variable
.Va sendwait
is set, therefore send errors will not be recognizable until then.
.Ic set Ns
ting (also via
.Fl S )
.Va editalong
will automatically startup an editor when compose mode is entered, and
editing of headers additionally to plain body content can be enabled via
.Va editheaders :
\*(ID some, but not all headers can be created, edited or deleted in an
editor, then.
.Va askcc
and
.Va askbcc
will cause the user to be prompted actively for (blind) carbon-copy
recipients, respectively, and (the default)
.Va asksend
will request confirmation whether the message shall be sent.
.
.Pp
The envelope sender address is defined by
.Va from ,
explicitly defining an originating
.Va hostname
may be desirable, especially with the built-in SMTP Mail-Transfer-Agent
.Va mta .
.Sx "Character sets"
for outgoing message and MIME part content are configurable via
.Va sendcharsets ,
whereas input data is assumed to be in
.Va ttycharset .
Message data will be passed over the wire in a
.Va mime-encoding .
MIME parts a.k.a. attachments need to be assigned a
.Ic mimetype ,
usually taken out of
.Sx "The mime.types files" .
Saving a copy of sent messages in a
.Va record
mailbox may be desirable \(en as for most mailbox
.Ic file
targets the value will undergo
.Sx "Filename transformations" .
Some introductional
.Fl d
or
.Va debug
sandbox dry-run tests will prove correctness.
.
.Pp
Message recipients (as specified on the command line or defined in
.Ql To: ,
.Ql Cc:
or
.Ql Bcc: )
are subject to
.Ic alternates
filtering, and may not only be email addressees but can also be names of
mailboxes and even complete shell command pipe specifications.
If the variable
.Va expandaddr
is not set then only network addresses (see
.Xr mailaddr 7
for a description of mail addresses) and plain user names (including MTA
aliases) may be used, other types will be filtered out, giving a warning
message.
A network address that contains no domain-, but only a valid local user
.Ql <name>
in angle brackets will be automatically expanded to a valid address when
.Va hostname
is set to a non-empty value; setting it to the empty value instructs
\*(UA that the used
.Va mta
will perform the necessary expansion.
The command
.Ic addrcodec
may help to generate standard compliant network addresses.
.
.\" When changing any of the following adjust any RECIPIENTADDRSPEC;
.\" grep the latter for the complete picture
.Pp
If the variable
.Va expandaddr
is set then an extended set of recipient addresses will be accepted:
Any name that starts with a vertical bar
.Ql |
character specifies a command pipe \(en the command string following the
.Ql |
is executed and the message is sent to its standard input;
Likewise, any name that consists only of hyphen-minus
.Ql -
or starts with the character solidus
.Ql /
or the character sequence dot solidus
.Ql ./
is treated as a file, regardless of the remaining content.
Any other name which contains a commercial at
.Ql @
character is a network address;
Any other name which starts with a plus sign
.Ql +
character is a mailbox name;
Any other name which contains a solidus
.Ql /
character but no exclamation mark
.Ql \&!
or percent sign
.Ql %
character before is also a mailbox name;
What remains is treated as a network address.

To create file-carbon-copies the special recipient header
.Ql Fcc:
may be used as often as desired.
Its entire value (or body in standard terms) is interpreted as a
.Ic file
target, after having been subject to
.Sx "Filename transformations" .
Beside using the command escape
.Ic ~^
(to create a
.Ql Fcc
header) this is the only way to create a file-carbon-copy without
introducing an ambiguity regarding the interpretation of the address,
e.g., to use file names with leading vertical bars or commercial ats.
Like all other recipients
.Ql Fcc:
is subject to the checks of
.Va expandaddr .
Any local file and pipe command addressee honours the setting of
.Va mbox-fcc-and-pcc .
.
.Pp
It is possible to create personal distribution lists via the
.Ic alias
command, so that, for instance, the user can send mail to
.Ql cohorts
and have it go to a group of people.
Different to the alias mechanism of a local
.Va mta ,
which is often tracked in a file
.Pa /etc/aliases ,
documented in
.Xr aliases 5 ,
and the names of which are subject to the
.Ql name
constraint of
.Va expandaddr ,
personal aliases will be expanded by \*(UA before the message is sent.
They are thus a convenient alternative to specifying each addressee by
itself, correlate with the active set of
.Ic alternates ,
and are subject to
.Va metoo
filtering.

For the purpose of arranging a complete environment of settings that can
be switched to with a single command or command line option there are
.Ic account Ns s .
Alternatively it is also possible to use a flat configuration, making use
of so-called variable chains which automatically pick
.Ql USER@HOST
or
.Ql HOST
context-dependent variable variants: for example addressing
.Ql Ic File Ns \& pop3://yaa@exam.ple
would find
.Va \&\&pop3-no-apop-yaa@exam.ple ,
.Va \&\&pop3-no-apop-exam.ple
and

in order.

The compose mode hooks
.Va on-compose-enter , on-compose-splice , on-compose-leave
and
.Va on-compose-cleanup
may be set to
.Ic define Ns
d macros and provide reliable and increasingly powerful mechanisms to
perform automated message adjustments dependent on message context,
for example addition of message signatures
.Pf ( Va message-inject-head , message-inject-tail )
or creation of additional receiver lists (also by setting
.Va autocc , autobcc ) .
To achieve that the command
.Ic digmsg
may be used in order to query and adjust status of message(s).
The splice hook can also make use of
.Sx "COMMAND ESCAPES" .
(\*(ID The compose mode hooks work for
.Ic forward , mail , reply
and variants;
.Ic resend
and
.Ic Resend
only provide the hooks
.Va on-resend-enter
and
.Va on-resend-cleanup ,
which are pretty restricted due to the nature of the operation.)
.
.Pp
To avoid environmental noise scripts should
.Dq detach
\*(UA from any configuration files and create a script-local
environment, ideally with the command line options
.Fl \&:
to disable any configuration file in conjunction with repetitions of
.Fl S
to specify variables:

.Pp
As shown, scripts can
.Dq fake
a locale environment, the above specifies the all-compatible 7-bit clean
.Ev LC_ALL
.Dq C ,
but will nonetheless take and send UTF-8 in the message text by using
.Va ttycharset .
If character set conversion is compiled in
.Pf ( Va features
includes the term
.Ql +iconv )
invalid (according to
.Va ttycharset )
character input data would normally cause errors; setting
.Va mime-force-sendout
will instead, as a last resort, classify the input as binary data, and
therefore allow message creation to be successful.
(Such content can then be inspected either by installing a
.Va pipe-TYPE/SUBTYPE
handler for

or possibly automatically through

When used like that the user's system
.Va inbox
(for more on mailbox types please see the command
.Ic file )
is read in and a one line header of each message therein is displayed if
the variable

At the

the command

one can type
.Ql help X
.Pf "(or " Ql \&?X )
and see the actual expansion of
.Ql X
and what its purpose is, i.e., commands can be abbreviated
(note that POSIX defines some abbreviations, so that the alphabetical
order of commands does not necessarily relate to the abbreviations; it is
however possible to define overwrites with
.Ic commandalias ) .
These commands can also produce a more
.Va verbose
output.
.
.Pp
Messages are given numbers (starting at 1) which uniquely identify
messages; the current message \(en the
.Dq dot
\(en will either be the first new message, or the first unread message,
or the first message of the mailbox; the internal variable
.Va showlast
will instead cause usage of the last message for this purpose.
The command
.Ic headers
will display a
.Va screen Ns
ful of header summaries containing the
.Dq dot ,
whereas
.Ic from
will display only the summaries of the given messages, defaulting to the
.Dq dot .
.
.Pp
Message content can be displayed with the command
.Ic type
.Pf ( Ql t ,
alias
.Ic print ) .
Here the variable
.Va crt
controls whether and when \*(UA will use the configured
.Ev PAGER
for display instead of directly writing to the user terminal
.Va screen ,
the sole difference to the command
.Ic more ,
which will always use the
.Ev PAGER .
The command
.Ic top
will instead only show the first

Message display experience may improve by setting and adjusting
.Va mime-counter-evidence ,
and also see
.Sx "HTML mail and MIME attachments" .
.
.Pp
By default the current message
.Pf ( Dq dot )
is displayed, but like with many other commands it is possible to give
a fancy message specification (see
.Sx "Specifying messages" ) ,
e.g.,
.Ql t:u
will display all unread messages,
.Ql t.
will display the

.Ql t 1 5
will type the messages 1 and 5,
.Ql t 1-5

will display the previous and the next message, respectively.
The command
.Ic search

.Ic from )
will display a header summary of the given message specification list
instead of their content, e.g., the following will search for subjects:
.
.Pp
.Dl ? from "'@Some subject to search for'"
.
.Pp
In the default setup all header fields of a message will be
.Ic type Ns

applications by using the command
.Ic headerpick ,
e.g., to restrict their display to a very restricted set for
.Ic type :
.Ql Ic \:headerpick Cd \:type retain Ar \:from to cc subject .
In order to display all header fields of a message regardless of
currently active ignore or retain lists, use the commands
.Ic Type
and
.Ic Top ;
.Ic Show
will show the raw message content.
Note that historically the global

not only adjusts the list of displayed headers, but also sets
.Va crt .
(\*(ID A yet somewhat restricted) Reliable scriptable message

aims at making the user experience with the many

the message being replied to will be included in a quoted form.
.Ic forward Ns

It is possible to
.Ic resend

messages: the former will add a series of
.Ql Resent-

.Ss "HTML mail and MIME attachments"
.
Messages which are HTML-only become more and more common, and of course
many messages come bundled with a bouquet of MIME (Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions) parts.
To get a notion of MIME types \*(UA has a default set of types built-in,
onto which the content of
.Sx "The mime.types files"
will be added (as configured and allowed by
.Va mimetypes-load-control ) .
Types can also become registered with the command
.Ic mimetype .
To improve interaction with faulty MIME part declarations which are
often seen in real-life messages, setting
.Va mime-counter-evidence
will allow verification of the given assertion, and possible provision
of an alternative, better MIME type.
.
.Pp
Whereas \*(UA \*(OPally supports a simple HTML-to-text filter for
displaying HTML messages, it cannot handle MIME types other than plain
text itself.
Instead programs need to become registered to deal with specific MIME
types or file extensions.
These programs may either prepare plain text versions of their input in
order to enable \*(UA to integrate their output neatlessly in its own
message visualization (a mode which is called
.Cd copiousoutput ) ,
or display the content themselves, for example in an external graphical
window: such handlers will only be considered by and for the command
.Ic mimeview .
.
.Pp
To install a handler program for a specific MIME type an according
.Va pipe-TYPE/SUBTYPE
variable needs to be set; to instead define a handler for a specific
file extension the respective
.Va pipe-EXTENSION
variable can be used \(en these handlers take precedence.
\*(OPally \*(UA supports mail user agent configuration as defined in
RFC 1524; this mechanism (see
.Sx "The Mailcap files" )
will be queried for display or quote handlers if none of the former two
.\" TODO v15-compat "will be" -> "is"
did; it will be the sole source for handlers of other purpose.
A last source for handlers is the MIME type definition itself, if

.
.\" .Ss "Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME" {{{
.Ss "Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME"
.
\*(OP S/MIME provides two central mechanisms:
message signing and message encryption.
A signed message contains some data in addition to the regular text.
The data can be used to verify that the message has been sent using
a valid certificate, that the sender address matches that in the
certificate, and that the message text has not been altered.
Signing a message does not change its regular text;
it can be read regardless of whether the recipients software is able to
handle S/MIME.
It is thus usually possible to sign all outgoing messages if so desired.
.
.Pp
Encryption, in contrast, makes the message text invisible for all people
except those who have access to the secret decryption key.
To encrypt a message, the specific recipients public encryption key
must be known.
It is therefore not possible to send encrypted mail to people unless their
key has been retrieved from either previous communication or public key
directories.
Because signing is performed with private keys, and encryption with
public keys, messages should always be signed before becoming encrypted.
.
.Pp
A central concept to S/MIME is that of the certification authority (CA).
A CA is a trusted institution that issues certificates.
For each of these certificates it can be verified that it really
originates from the CA, provided that the CA's own certificate is
previously known.
A set of CA certificates is usually delivered and installed together
with the cryptographical library that is used on the local system.
Therefore reasonable security for S/MIME on the Internet is provided if
the source that provides that library installation is trusted.
It is also possible to use a specific pool of trusted certificates.
If this is desired,
.Va smime-ca-no-defaults
should be set to avoid using the default certificate pool, and
.Va smime-ca-file
and/or
.Va smime-ca-dir
should be pointed to a trusted pool of certificates.
A certificate cannot be more secure than the method its CA certificate
has been retrieved with.
.
.Pp
This trusted pool of certificates is used by the command
.Ic verify
to ensure that the given S/MIME messages can be trusted.
If so, verified sender certificates that were embedded in signed
messages can be saved locally with the command
.Ic certsave ,
and used by \*(UA to encrypt further communication with these senders:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
? certsave FILENAME
? set smime-encrypt-USER@HOST=FILENAME \e
    smime-cipher-USER@HOST=AES256
.Ed
.
.Pp
To sign outgoing messages, in order to allow receivers to verify the
origin of these messages, a personal S/MIME certificate is required.
\*(UA supports password-protected personal certificates (and keys), see
.Va smime-sign-cert .
The section
.Sx "On URL syntax and credential lookup"
gives an overview of the possible sources of user credentials, and
.Sx "S/MIME step by step"
shows examplarily how a private S/MIME certificate can be obtained.
In general, if such a private key plus certificate
.Dq pair
is available, all that needs to be done is to set some variables:

\*(IN For accessing protocol-specific resources usage of Uniform
Resource Locators (URL, RFC 1738) has become omnipresent.
\*(UA expects and understands URLs in the following form;
parts in brackets
.Ql []
denote optional parts, optional either because there also exist other
ways to define the information in question or because support of the
part is protocol-specific, e.g.,
.Ql /path
is used by the \*(OPal Maildir directory and the IMAP protocol, but not
by POP3; If any of
.Ql USER
and
.Ql PASSWORD
are specified they must be given in URL percent encoded form (RFC 3986;
the command
.Ic urlcodec
may be helpful):
.
.Pp
.Dl PROTOCOL://[USER[:PASSWORD]@]server[:port][/path]
.
.Pp
Note that these \*(UA URLs most often do not conform to any real
standard, but instead represent a normalized variant of RFC 1738 \(en
they are not used in data exchange but only meant as a compact,
easy-to-use way of defining and representing information in
a well-known notation.
.
.Pp
Many internal variables of \*(UA exist in multiple versions, called
variable chains for the rest of this document: the plain
.Ql variable
as well as
.Ql variable-HOST
and
.Ql variable-USER@HOST .
Here
.Ql HOST
indeed means
.Ql server:port
if a
.Ql port
had been specified in the respective URL, otherwise it refers to the plain
.Ql server .
Also,
.Ql USER
is not truly the
.Ql USER
that had been found when doing the user chain lookup as is described
below, i.e., this
.Ql USER
will never be in URL percent encoded form, whether it came from an URL
or not; i.e., variable chain name extensions of
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
must not be URL percent encoded.
.
.Pp
For example, whether an hypothetical URL
.Ql smtp://hey%3Ayou@our.house
had been given that includes a user, or whether the URL was
.Ql smtp://our.house
and the user had been found differently, to lookup the variable chain
.Va smtp-use-starttls
\*(UA first looks for whether
.Ql smtp-\:use-\:starttls-\:hey:you@our.house
is defined, then whether
.Ql smtp-\:use-\:starttls-\:our.house
exists before finally ending up looking at the plain variable itself.
.
.Pp
\*(UA obeys the following logic scheme when dealing with the
necessary credential information of an account:
.
.Bl -bullet
.It
If no
.Ql USER
has been given in the URL the variables
.Va user-HOST
and
.Va user
are looked up.
If no such variable(s) can be found then \*(UA will,
when enforced by the \*(OPal variables
.Va netrc-lookup-HOST
or
.Va netrc-lookup ,
search
.Sx "The .netrc file"
of the user for a
.Ql HOST
specific entry which provides a
.Ql login
name: this lookup will only succeed if unambiguous (one possible matching
entry for
.Ql HOST ) .
.Pp
If there is still no
.Ql USER
then \*(UA will fall back to the user who is supposed to run \*(UA,
the identity of which has been fixated during \*(UA startup and is
known to be a valid user on the current host.
.
.It
Authentication: unless otherwise noted this will lookup the
.Va PROTOCOL-auth-USER@HOST , PROTOCOL-auth-HOST , PROTOCOL-auth
variable chain, falling back to a protocol-specific default should this
have no success.
.
.It
If no
.Ql PASSWORD
has been given in the URL, then if the
.Ql USER
has been found through the \*(OPal
.Va netrc-lookup
that may have already provided the password, too.
Otherwise the variable chain
.Va password-USER@HOST , password-HOST , password
is looked up and used if existent.
.Pp
Afterwards the complete \*(OPal variable chain
.Va netrc-lookup-USER@HOST , netrc-lookup-HOST , netrc-lookup
is looked up.
If set, the
.Ic netrc
cache is searched for a password only (multiple user accounts for
a single machine may exist as well as a fallback entry without user
but with a password).
.Pp
If at that point there is still no password available, but the
(protocols') chosen authentication type requires a password, then in
interactive mode the user will be prompted on the terminal.

.Sy Note:
S/MIME verification works relative to the values found in the

and
.Va smime-sign-digest
will not be looked up using the
.Ql USER
and

chains from above but instead use the corresponding values from the
message that is being worked on.
In unusual cases multiple and different
.Ql USER

combinations may therefore be involved \(en on the other hand those
unusual cases become possible.

.Ss "Encrypted network communication"
.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) a.k.a. its successor TLS (Transport Layer
Security) are protocols which aid in securing communication by providing
a safely initiated and encrypted network connection.
A central concept of TLS is that of certificates: as part of each
network connection setup a (set of) certificates will be exchanged, and
by using those the identity of the network peer can be cryptographically
verified; if possible the TLS/SNI (ServerNameIndication) extension will
be enabled in order to allow servers fine-grained control over the
certificates being used.
TLS works by using a locally installed pool of trusted certificates,
and verifying the connection peer succeeds if that provides
a certificate which has been issued or is trusted by any certificate in
the trusted local pool.
.
.Pp
The local pool of trusted so-called CA (Certification Authority)
certificates is usually delivered with the used TLS library, and
will be selected automatically.
It is also possible to use a specific pool of trusted certificates.
If this is desired,
.Va tls-ca-no-defaults
should be set to avoid using the default certificate pool, and
.Va tls-ca-file
and/or (with special preparation)
.Va tls-ca-dir
should be pointed to a trusted pool of certificates.
A certificate cannot be more secure than the method its CA certificate
has been retrieved with.
For inspection or other purposes, the certificate of a server (as seen
when connecting to it) can be fetched like this:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ </dev/null openssl s_client -showcerts -connect \e
    the-server.example:pop3s 2>&1 | tee log.txt
.Ed
.
.Pp
\*(UA also supports a mode of operation in which certificates are not
at all matched against a local pool of CA certificates.
Instead a message digest will be calculated for the certificate
presented by the connection peer, and be compared against
.Va tls-fingerprint
(a variable chain that picks up
.Ql USER@HOST
or
.Ql HOST
context-dependent variable variants), and the connection will succeed if
the calculated digest equals the expected one.
The used message digest can be configured via (the chain)
.Va tls-fingerprint-digest .
The command
.Ic tls
may be helpful.
.
.Pp
It depends on the used protocol whether encrypted communication is
possible, and which configuration steps have to be taken to enable it.
Some protocols, e.g., POP3S, are implicitly encrypted, others, like
POP3, can upgrade a plain text connection if so requested.
For example, to use the
.Ql STLS
that POP3 offers (a member of) the variable (chain)
.Va pop3-use-starttls
needs to be set:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
shortcut encpop1 pop3s://pop1.exam.ple

shortcut encpop2 pop3://pop2.exam.ple
set pop3-use-starttls-pop2.exam.ple

set mta=smtps://smtp.exam.ple:465
set mta=smtp://smtp.exam.ple smtp-use-starttls
.Ed
.
.Pp
Normally that is all there is to do, given that TLS libraries try to
provide safe defaults, plenty of knobs however exist to adjust settings.
For example certificate verification settings can be fine-tuned via
.Va tls-ca-flags ,
and the TLS configuration basics are accessible via
.Va tls-config-pairs ,
for example to specify the allowed protocols or cipher lists that
a communication channel may use.
In the past hints on how to restrict the set of protocols to highly
secure ones were indicated, but as of the time of this writing the list
of protocols or ciphers may need to become relaxed in order to be able
to connect to some servers; the following example allows connecting to a
.Dq Lion
that uses OpenSSL 0.9.8za from June 2014 (refer to
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
for more on variable chains):
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
wysh set tls-config-pairs-lion@exam.ple='MinProtocol=TLSv1.1,\e

      DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:@STRENGTH'
.Ed
.
.Pp
The OpenSSL program
.Xr ciphers 1
can be used and should be referred to when creating a custom cipher list.

.Va tls-ca-file ,
.Va tls-ca-flags ,
.Va tls-ca-no-defaults ,
.Va tls-config-file ,

.
.\" .Ss "Character sets" {{{
.Ss "Character sets"
.
\*(OP \*(UA detects the character set of the terminal by using
mechanisms that are controlled by the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
environment variable
(in fact
.Ev LC_ALL ,
.Ev \&\&LC_CTYPE ,
.Ev LANG ,
in that order, see there).
The internal variable
.Va ttycharset
will be set to the detected terminal character set accordingly,
and will thus show up in the output of commands like, e.g.,
.Ic set
and
.Ic varshow .
.
.Pp
However, the user may give
.Va ttycharset
a value during startup, making it possible to send mail in a completely
.Dq faked
locale environment, an option which can be used to generate and send,
e.g., 8-bit UTF-8 input data in a pure 7-bit US-ASCII
.Ql LC_ALL=C
environment (an example of this can be found in the section
.Sx "On sending mail, and non-interactive mode" ) .
Changing the value does not mean much beside that, because several
aspects of the real character set are implied by the locale environment
of the system, which stays unaffected by
.Va ttycharset .
.
.Pp
Messages and attachments which consist of 7-bit clean data will be
classified as consisting of
.Va charset-7bit
character data.
This is a problem if the
.Va ttycharset
character set is a multibyte character set that is also 7-bit clean.
For example, the Japanese character set ISO-2022-JP is 7-bit clean but
capable to encode the rich set of Japanese Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana
characters: in order to notify receivers of this character set the mail
message must be MIME encoded so that the character set ISO-2022-JP can
be advertised!
To achieve this, the variable
.Va charset-7bit
must be set to ISO-2022-JP.
(Today a better approach regarding email is the usage of UTF-8, which
uses 8-bit bytes for non-US-ASCII data.)
.
.Pp
If the \*(OPal character set conversion capabilities are not available
.Pf ( Va features
does not include the term
.Ql +iconv ) ,
then
.Va ttycharset
will be the only supported character set,
it is simply assumed that it can be used to exchange 8-bit messages
(over the wire an intermediate, configurable
.Va mime-encoding
may be applied),
and the rest of this section does not apply;
it may however still be necessary to explicitly set it if automatic
detection fails, since in that case it defaults to
.\" (Keep in SYNC: ./nail.1:"Character sets", mx/config.h:CHARSET_*!)
LATIN1 a.k.a. ISO-8859-1 unless the operating system environment is
known to always and exclusively support UTF-8 locales.
.
.Pp
\*(OP When reading messages, their text is converted into
.Va ttycharset
as necessary in order to display them on the user's terminal.
Unprintable characters and invalid byte sequences are detected
and replaced by proper substitution characters.
Character set mappings for source character sets can be established with
the command
.Ic charsetalias ,
which may be handy to work around faulty character set catalogues (e.g.,
to add a missing LATIN1 to ISO-8859-1 mapping), or to enforce treatment
of one character set as another one (e.g., to interpret LATIN1 as CP1252).
Also see
.Va charset-unknown-8bit
to deal with another hairy aspect of message interpretation.
.
.Pp
When sending messages their parts and attachments are classified.
Whereas no character set conversion is performed on those parts which
appear to be binary data,
the character set being used must be declared within the MIME header of
an outgoing text part if it contains characters that do not conform to
the set of characters that are allowed by the email standards.
Permissible values for character sets used in outgoing messages can be
declared using the
.Va sendcharsets
variable, and
.Va charset-8bit ,
which defines a catch-all last-resort fallback character set that is
implicitly appended to the list of character sets in
.Va sendcharsets .
.
.Pp
When replying to a message and the variable
.Va reply-in-same-charset
is set, then the character set of the message being replied to
is tried first (still being a subject of
.Ic charsetalias ) .
And it is also possible to make \*(UA work even more closely related to
the current locale setting automatically by using the variable
.Va sendcharsets-else-ttycharset ,
please see there for more information.
.
.Pp
All the specified character sets are tried in order unless the
conversion of the part or attachment succeeds.
If none of the tried (8-bit) character sets is capable to represent the
content of the part or attachment,
then the message will not be send and its text will optionally be
.Va save Ns d
in
.Ev DEAD .
If that is not acceptible, the variable
.Va mime-force-sendout
can be set in order to force sending of non-convertible text as
.Ql application/octet-stream
classified binary content instead; like this receivers still have the
option to inspect message content (for example by setting
.Va mime-counter-evidence ) .
.
.Pp
In general, if a message saying
.Dq cannot convert from a to b
appears, either some characters are not appropriate for the currently
selected (terminal) character set,
or the needed conversion is not supported by the system.
In the first case, it is necessary to set an appropriate
.Ev LC_CTYPE
locale and/or the variable
.Va ttycharset .
The best results are usually achieved when \*(UA is run in a UTF-8
locale on an UTF-8 capable terminal, in which case the full Unicode
spectrum of characters is available.
In this setup characters from various countries can be displayed,
while it is still possible to use more simple character sets for sending
to retain maximum compatibility with older mail clients.
.
.Pp
On the other hand the POSIX standard defines a locale-independent 7-bit
.Dq portable character set
that should be used when overall portability is an issue, the even more
restricted subset named
.Dq portable filename character set
consists of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, period

underscore

and hyphen-minus

.Ss "On terminal control and line editor"
.
\*(OP Terminal control will be realized through one of the standard
.Ux
libraries, either the
.Lb libtermcap ,
or, alternatively, the
.Lb libterminfo ,
both of which will be initialized to work with the environment variable
.Ev TERM .
Terminal control will enhance or enable interactive usage aspects, e.g.,
.Sx "Coloured display" ,
and extend behaviour of the Mailx-Line-Editor (MLE), which may learn the
byte-sequences of keys like the cursor- and function-keys.
.
.Pp
The internal variable
.Va termcap
can be used to overwrite settings or to learn (correct(ed)) keycodes.
Actual library interaction can be disabled completely by setting
.Va termcap-disable ;
.Va termcap
will be queried regardless, which is true even if the \*(OPal library
support has not been enabled at configuration time as long as some other
\*(OP which (may) query terminal control sequences has been enabled.
\*(UA can be told to enter an alternative exclusive screen, the
so-called ca-mode, by setting
.Va termcap-ca-mode ;
this requires sufficient terminal support, and the used
.Ev PAGER
may also need special configuration, dependent on the value of
.Va crt .
.
.Pp
\*(OP The built-in Mailx-Line-Editor (MLE) should work in all
environments which comply to the ISO C standard
.St -isoC-amd1 ,
and will support wide glyphs if possible (the necessary functionality
had been removed from ISO C, but was included in
.St -xpg4 ) .
Usage of a line editor in interactive mode can be prevented by setting
.Va line-editor-disable .
Especially if the \*(OPal terminal control support is missing setting
entries in the internal variable
.Va termcap
will help shall the MLE misbehave, see there for more.
The MLE can support a little bit of
.Ic colour .
.
.Pp
\*(OP If the
.Ic history
feature is available then input from line editor prompts will be saved
in a history list that can be searched in and be expanded from.
Such saving can be prevented by prefixing input with any amount of
whitespace.
Aspects of history, like allowed content and maximum size, as well as
whether history shall be saved persistently, can be configured with the
internal variables
.Va history-file ,
.Va history-gabby ,
.Va history-gabby-persist
and
.Va history-size .
There also exists the macro hook
.Va on-history-addition
which can be used to apply fine control on what enters history.
.
.Pp
The MLE supports a set of editing and control commands.
By default (as) many (as possible) of these will be assigned to a set of
single-letter control codes, which should work on any terminal (and can
be generated by holding the
.Dq control
key while pressing the key of desire, e.g.,
.Ql control-D ) .
If the \*(OPal
.Ic bind
command is available then the MLE commands can also be accessed freely
by assigning the command name, which is shown in parenthesis in the list
below, to any desired key-sequence, and the MLE will instead and also use
.Ic bind
to establish its built-in key bindings
(more of them if the \*(OPal terminal control is available),
an action which can then be suppressed completely by setting

On top of what \*(UA knows about the terminal the boolean variable

through the external program defined by the environment variable

This is not enabled by default because different pager programs need
different command line switches or other configuration in order to
support those sequences.
\*(UA however knows about some widely used pagers and in a clean

Colours and font attributes can be managed with the multiplexer command

An unquoted reverse solidus

used as a follow-up line, with all leading whitespace removed;
once an entire line is completed, the whitespace characters
.Cm space , tabulator , newline
as well as those defined by the variable
.Va ifs
are removed from the beginning and end.
Placing any whitespace characters at the beginning of a line will
prevent a possible addition of the command line to the \*(OPal

The beginning of such input lines is then scanned for the name of

A name may also be a

documented in the following.

This behaviour is different to the

evaluate individual elements of a line.

parameters fully support
.Va ifs
for an almost shell-compatible field splitting:
.Ic call , call_if , read , vpospar , xcall .
.Ed
.
.Pp
Any unquoted number sign
.Ql #
at the beginning of a new token starts a comment that extends to the end
of the line, and therefore ends argument processing.
An unquoted dollar sign
.Ql $
will cause variable expansion of the given name, which must be a valid
.Xr sh 1 Ns
ell-style variable name (see
.Cm vput ) :
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
as well as
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
(shell) variables can be accessed through this mechanism, brace
enclosing the name is supported (i.e., to subdivide a token).
.
.Pp
Whereas the metacharacters
.Cm space , tabulator , newline
only complete an input token, vertical bar
.Cm \&| ,
ampersand
.Cm &
and semicolon
.Cm \&;
also act as control operators and perform control functions.
For now supported is semicolon
.Cm \&; ,
which terminates a single command, therefore sequencing the command line
and making the remainder of the line a subject to reevaluation.
With sequencing, multiple command argument types and quoting rules may
therefore apply to a single line, which can become problematic before
v15: e.g., the first of the following will cause surprising results.
.
.Pp
.Dl ? echo one; set verbose; echo verbose=$verbose.
.Dl ? echo one; wysh set verbose; echo verbose=$verbose.
.
.Pp
Quoting is a mechanism that will remove the special meaning of
metacharacters and reserved words, and will prevent expansion.
There are four quoting mechanisms: the escape character, single-quotes,
double-quotes and dollar-single-quotes:
.
.
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
The literal value of any character can be preserved by preceding it
with the escape character reverse solidus
.Ql \e .
.
.It
Arguments which are enclosed in
.Ql 'single-\:quotes'
retain their literal value.
A single-quote cannot occur within single-quotes.
.
.It
The literal value of all characters enclosed in
.Ql \(dqdouble-\:quotes\(dq
is retained, with the exception of dollar sign
.Ql $ ,
which will cause variable expansion, as above, backquote (grave accent)
.Ql ` ,
(which not yet means anything special), reverse solidus
.Ql \e ,
which will escape any of the characters dollar sign
.Ql $
(to prevent variable expansion), backquote (grave accent)
.Ql ` ,
double-quote
.Ql \(dq
(to prevent ending the quote) and reverse solidus
.Ql \e
(to prevent escaping, i.e., to embed a reverse solidus character as-is),
but has no special meaning otherwise.
.
.It
Arguments enclosed in
.Ql $'dollar-\:single-\:quotes'
extend normal single quotes in that reverse solidus escape sequences are
expanded as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width ".Ql \eNNN"
.It Ql \ea
bell control character (ASCII and ISO-10646 BEL).
.It Ql \eb
backspace control character (ASCII and ISO-10646 BS).
.It Ql \eE
escape control character (ASCII and ISO-10646 ESC).
.It Ql \ee
the same.
.It Ql \ef
form feed control character (ASCII and ISO-10646 FF).
.It Ql \en
line feed control character (ASCII and ISO-10646 LF).
.It Ql \er
carriage return control character (ASCII and ISO-10646 CR).
.It Ql \et
horizontal tabulator control character (ASCII and ISO-10646 HT).
.It Ql \ev
vertical tabulator control character (ASCII and ISO-10646 VT).
.It Ql \e\e
emits a reverse solidus character.
.It Ql \e'
single quote.
.It Ql \e"
double quote (escaping is optional).
.It Ql \eNNN
eight-bit byte with the octal value
.Ql NNN
(one to three octal digits), optionally prefixed by an additional
.Ql 0 .
A 0 byte will suppress further output for the quoted argument.
.It Ql \exHH
eight-bit byte with the hexadecimal value
.Ql HH
(one or two hexadecimal characters, no prefix, see
.Ic vexpr ) .
A 0 byte will suppress further output for the quoted argument.
.It Ql \eUHHHHHHHH
the Unicode / ISO-10646 character with the hexadecimal codepoint value
.Ql HHHHHHHH
(one to eight hexadecimal characters) \(em note that Unicode defines the
maximum codepoint ever to be supported as
.Ql 0x10FFFF
(in planes of
.Ql 0xFFFF
characters each).
This escape is only supported in locales that support Unicode (see
.Sx "Character sets" ) ,
in other cases the sequence will remain unexpanded unless the given code
point is ASCII compatible or (if the \*(OPal character set conversion is
available) can be represented in the current locale.
The character NUL will suppress further output for the quoted argument.
.It Ql \euHHHH
Identical to
.Ql \eUHHHHHHHH
except it takes only one to four hexadecimal characters.
.It Ql \ecX
Emits the non-printable (ASCII and compatible) C0 control codes
0 (NUL) to 31 (US), and 127 (DEL).
Printable representations of ASCII control codes can be created by
mapping them to a different, visible part of the ASCII character set.
Adding the number 64 achieves this for the codes 0 to 31, e.g., 7 (BEL):
.Ql 7 + 64 = 71 = G .
The real operation is a bitwise logical XOR with 64 (bit 7 set, see
.Ic vexpr ) ,
thus also covering code 127 (DEL), which is mapped to 63 (question mark):
.Ql \&?\0vexpr\0^\0127\064 .
.Pp
Whereas historically circumflex notation has often been used for
visualization purposes of control codes, e.g.,
.Ql ^G ,
the reverse solidus notation has been standardized:
.Ql \ecG .
Some control codes also have standardized (ISO-10646, ISO C) aliases,
as shown above (e.g.,
.Ql \ea ,
.Ql \en ,
.Ql \et ) :
whenever such an alias exists it will be used for display purposes.
The control code NUL
.Pf ( Ql \ec@ ,
a non-standard extension) will suppress further output for the remains
of the token (which may extend beyond the current quote), or, depending
on the context, the remains of all arguments for the current command.
.It Ql \e$NAME
Non-standard extension: expand the given variable name, as above.
Brace enclosing the name is supported.
.It Ql \e`{command}
Not yet supported, just to raise awareness: Non-standard extension.

Decoding will show how a standard-compliant MUA will display the given

Please be aware that most MUAs have difficulties with the address
standards, and vary wildly when (comments) in parenthesis,

strings, or quoted-pairs, as below, become involved.
\*(ID \*(UA currently does not perform decoding when displaying addresses.

set to

if decoding fails to find a(n) (valid) email address, in which case the
unmodified input will be output again.
.

first performs a skin operation, and thereafter checks a valid
address for whether it is a registered mailing list (see

eventually reporting that state in the error number
.Va \&!
as
.Va ^ERR Ns -EXIST .
(This state could later become overwritten by an I/O error, though.)
.
.Pp
Encoding supports four different modes, lesser automated versions can be
chosen by prefixing one, two or three plus signs: the standard imposes
a special meaning on some characters, which thus have to be transformed
to so-called quoted-pairs by pairing them with a reverse solidus
.Ql \e
in order to remove the special meaning; this might change interpretation
of the entire argument from what has been desired, however!
Specify one plus sign to remark that parenthesis shall be left alone,
two for not turning double quotation marks into quoted-pairs, and three
for also leaving any user-specified reverse solidus alone.
The result will always be valid, if a successful exit status is reported
(\*(ID the current parser fails this assertion for some constructs).
\*(ID Addresses need to be specified in between angle brackets
.Ql < ,
.Ql >
if the construct becomes more difficult, otherwise the current parser
will fail; it is not smart enough to guess right.

The latter command removes from the given context the given key binding,
both of which may be specified as a wildcard
.Ql * ,
so that, e.g.,
.Ql unbind * *
will remove all bindings of all contexts.
Due to initialization order unbinding will not work for built-in key
bindings upon program startup, however: please use
.Va line-editor-no-defaults
for this purpose instead.
.
.Pp
With zero arguments, or with a context name the former command shows all
key bindings (of the given context; an asterisk
.Ql *
will iterate over all contexts); a more verbose listing will be
produced if either of
.Va debug
or
.Va verbose
are set.
With two or more arguments a binding is (re)established:
the first argument is the context to which the binding shall apply,
the second argument is a comma-separated list of the
.Dq keys
which form the binding, and any remaining arguments form the expansion.
To indicate that a binding shall not be auto-committed, but that the
expansion shall instead be furtherly editable by the user, a commercial at
.Ql @
(that will be removed) can be placed last in the expansion, from which
leading and trailing whitespace will finally be removed.
Reverse solidus cannot be used as the last character of expansion.
An empty expansion will be rejected.
.
.Pp
Contexts define when a binding applies, i.e., a binding will not be seen
unless the context for which it is defined for is currently active.
This is not true for the shared binding
.Ql base ,
which is the foundation for all other bindings and as such always
applies, its bindings, however, only apply secondarily.
The available contexts are the shared
.Ql base ,
the
.Ql default
context which is used in all not otherwise documented situations, and
.Ql compose ,
which applies to compose mode only.
.
.Pp
.Dq Keys
which form the binding are specified as a comma-separated list of
byte-sequences, where each list entry corresponds to one key(press).
A list entry may, indicated by a leading colon character
.Ql \&: ,
also refer to the name of a terminal capability; several dozen names
will be compiled in and may be specified either by their
.Xr terminfo 5 ,
or, if existing, by their
.Xr termcap 5
name, regardless of the actually used \*(OPal terminal control library.
It is possible to use any capability, as long as the name is resolvable
by the \*(OPal control library or was defined via the internal variable
.Va termcap .
Input sequences are not case-normalized, so that an exact match is
required to update or remove a binding.
Examples:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
? bind base $'\eE',d mle-snarf-word-fwd # Esc(ape)
? bind base $'\eE',$'\ec?' mle-snarf-word-bwd # Esc,Delete
? bind default $'\ecA',:khome,w 'echo Editable binding@'
? bind default a,b,c rm -irf / @  # Also editable
? bind default :kf1 File %
? bind compose :kf1 ~v
.Ed
.
.Pp
Note that the entire comma-separated list is first parsed (over) as a
shell-token with whitespace as the field separator, before being parsed
and expanded for real with comma as the field separator, therefore
whitespace needs to be properly quoted, see
.Sx "Shell-style argument quoting" .
Using Unicode reverse solidus escape sequences renders a binding
defunctional if the locale does not support Unicode (see
.Sx "Character sets" ) ,
and using terminal capabilities does so if no (corresponding) terminal
control support is (currently) available.
.
.Pp
The following terminal capability names are built-in and can be used in
.Xr terminfo 5
or (if available) the two-letter
.Xr termcap 5
notation.
See the respective manual for a list of capabilities.
The program
.Xr infocmp 1

\*(NQ Define, list, and remove, respectively, file handler hooks,
which provide (shell) commands that enable \*(UA to load and save MBOX
files from and to files with the registered file extensions, as shown
and described for
.Ic file .
The extensions are used case-insensitively, yet the auto-completion
feature of, e.g.,
.Ic file
will only work case-sensitively.
An intermediate temporary file will be used to store the expanded data.
The latter command will remove hooks for all given extensions, asterisk
.Ql *
will remove all existing handlers.
.Pp
When used without arguments the former shows a list of all currently
defined file hooks, with one argument the expansion of the given alias.
Otherwise three arguments are expected, the first specifying the file
extension for which the hook is meant, and the second and third defining
the load- and save commands to deal with the file type, respectively,
both of which must read from standard input and write to standard
output.
Changing hooks will not affect already opened mailboxes (\*(ID except below).
\*(ID For now too much work is done, and files are oftened read in twice
where once would be sufficient: this can cause problems if a filetype is
changed while such a file is opened; this was already so with the
built-in support of .gz etc. in Heirloom, and will vanish in v15.
\*(ID For now all handler strings are passed to the
.Ev SHELL for evaluation purposes; in the future a
.Ql \&!
prefix to load and save commands may mean to bypass this shell instance:
placing a leading space will avoid any possible misinterpretations.

\*(NQ Multiplexer command to manage white- and blacklisting
selections of header fields for a variety of applications.
Without arguments the set of contexts that have settings is displayed.
When given arguments, the first argument is the context to which the
command applies, one of (case-insensitive)
.Ql type
for display purposes (via, e.g.,
.Ic type ) ,
.Ql save
for selecting which headers shall be stored persistently when
.Ic save ,
.Ic copy ,
.Ic move
or even
.Ic decrypt Ns
ing messages (note that MIME related etc. header fields should not be
ignored in order to not destroy usability of the message in this case),
.Ql forward
for stripping down messages when
.Ic forward Ns
ing message (has no effect if
.Va forward-as-attachment
is set), and
.Ql top
for defining user-defined set of fields for the command
.Ic top .
.Pp
The current settings of the given context are displayed if it is the
only argument.
A second argument denotes the type of restriction that is to be chosen,
it may be (a case-insensitive prefix of)
.Ql retain
or
.Ql ignore
for white- and blacklisting purposes, respectively.
Establishing a whitelist suppresses inspection of the corresponding
blacklist.
.Pp
If no further argument is given the current settings of the given type
will be displayed, otherwise the remaining arguments specify header
fields, which \*(OPally may be given as regular expressions, to be added
to the given type.
The special wildcard field (asterisk,
.Ql * )
will establish a (fast) shorthand setting which covers all fields.
.Pp
The latter command always takes three or more arguments and can be used
to remove selections, i.e., from the given context, the given type of
list, all the given headers will be removed, the special argument
.Ql *
will remove all headers.
.
.Mx
.It Ic headers
(h) Show the current group of headers, the size of which depends on
the variable
.Va screen
in interactive mode, and the format of which can be defined with
.Va headline .
If a message-specification is given the group of headers containing the
first message therein is shown and the message at the top of the screen
becomes the new

the last message is targeted if
.Va showlast
is set.

\*(OP Without arguments or when given
.Cm show
all history entries are shown (this mode also supports a more

output).
.Cm load
will replace the list of entries with the content of
.Va history-file ,
and
.Cm save
will dump the current list to said file, replacing former content.
.Cm clear
will delete all history entries.
The argument can also be a signed decimal
.Ar NUMBER ,
which will select and evaluate the respective history entry, and move it
to the top of the history; a negative number is used as an offset to the
current command, e.g.,
.Ql -1
will select the last command, the history top.

.Ev MBOX .
Does not override the
.Ic delete

.Mx
.It Ic if
(i) Part of the

conditional execution construct \(em if the given condition is true then
the encapsulated block is executed.
The POSIX standard only supports the (case-insensitive) conditions
.Ql r Ns
eceive
and
.Ql s Ns
end, the remaining are non-portable extensions.

.Ed
.
.Pp
Further (case-insensitive) one-argument conditions are
.Ql t Ns
erminal which evaluates to true in interactive (terminal) sessions,
as well as any boolean value (see
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
for textual boolean representations) to mark an enwrapped block as
.Dq never execute
or
.Dq always execute .
(Remarks: condition syntax errors skip all branches until
.Ic endif . )
.
.Pp
\*(OU and without
.Cm wysh :
It is possible to check
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
as well as
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
variables for existence or compare their expansion against a user given
value or another variable by using the
.Ql $
.Pf ( Dq variable next )
conditional trigger character;
a variable on the right hand side may be signalled using the same
mechanism.
Variable names may be enclosed in a pair of matching braces.
When this mode has been triggered, several operators are available
(\*(IN and
.Cm wysh :
they are always available, and there is no trigger: variables will have
been expanded by the shell-compatible parser before the
.Ic if
etc. command sees them).
.
.Pp
\*(IN Two argument conditions.
Variables can be tested for existence and expansion:
.Ql -N
will test whether the given variable exists, e.g.,
.Ql -N editalong
will evaluate to true when
.Va editalong
is set, whereas
.Ql -Z editalong
will if it is not.
.Ql -n """$editalong"""
will be true if the variable is set and expands to a non-empty string,
.Ql -z $'\e$editalong'
only if the expansion is empty, whether the variable exists or not.
The remaining conditions take three arguments.
.
.Pp
Integer operators treat the arguments on the left and right hand side of
the operator as integral numbers and compare them arithmetically.
It is an error if any of the operands is not a valid integer, an empty
argument (which implies it had been quoted) is treated as if it were 0.
Available operators are
.Ql -lt
(less than),
.Ql -le
(less than or equal to),
.Ql -eq
(equal),
.Ql -ne
(not equal),
.Ql -ge
(greater than or equal to), and
.Ql -gt
(greater than).
.
.Pp
String data operators compare the left and right hand side according to
their textual content.
Unset variables are treated as the empty string.
Via the question mark
.Ql \&?
modifier suffix a case-insensitive operation mode is available, the keyword
.Ql case
is optional, e.g.,
.Ql ==?
and
.Ql ==?case
are identical.
.
.Pp
Available string operators are
.Ql <
(less than),
.Ql <=
(less than or equal to),
.Ql ==
(equal),
.Ql !=
(not equal),
.Ql >=
(greater than or equal to),
.Ql >
(greater than),
.Ql =%
(is substring of) and
.Ql !%
(is not substring of).
By default these operators work on bytes and (therefore) do not take
into account character set specifics.
If the case-insensitivity modifier has been used, case is ignored
according to the rules of the US-ASCII encoding, i.e., bytes are
still compared.
.
.Pp
When the \*(OPal regular expression support is available, the additional
string operators
.Ql =~
and
.Ql !~
can be used.
They treat the right hand side as an extended regular expression that is
matched according to the active locale (see
.Sx "Character sets" ) ,
i.e., character sets should be honoured correctly.
.
.Pp
Conditions can be joined via AND-OR lists (where the AND operator is
.Ql &&
and the OR operator is
.Ql || ) ,
which have equal precedence and will be evaluated with left
associativity, thus using the same syntax that is known for the
.Xr sh 1 .
It is also possible to form groups of conditions and lists by enclosing
them in pairs of brackets
.Ql [\ \&.\&.\&.\ ] ,
which may be interlocked within each other, and also be joined via
AND-OR lists.
.
.Pp
The results of individual conditions and entire groups may be modified
via unary operators: the unary operator
.Ql \&!
will reverse the result.

.Mx
.It Ic localopts
Enforce change localization of
.Ic environ
(linked)
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
as well as (global)
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES" ,
meaning that their state will be reverted to the former one once the
.Dq covered scope
is left.
Just like the command modifier
.Cm local ,
which provides block-scope localization for some commands (instead),
it can only be used inside of macro definition blocks introduced by
.Ic account
or
.Ic define .
The covered scope of an
.Ic account
is left once a different account is activated, and some macros, notably
.Va folder-hook Ns s ,
use their own specific notion of covered scope, here it will be extended
until the folder is left again.
.
.Pp
This setting stacks up: i.e., if
.Ql macro1
enables change localization and calls
.Ql macro2 ,
which explicitly resets localization, then any value changes within
.Ql macro2
will still be reverted when the scope of
.Ql macro1
is left.
(Caveats: if in this example
.Ql macro2
changes to a different
.Ic account
which sets some variables that are already covered by localizations,
their scope will be extended, and in fact leaving the
.Ic account
will (thus) restore settings in (likely) global scope which actually
were defined in a local, macro private context!)
.
.Pp
This command takes one or two arguments, the optional first one
specifies an attribute that may be one of
.Cm \&\&scope ,
which refers to the current scope and is thus the default,
.Cm call ,
which causes any macro that is being
.Ic call Ns
ed to be started with localization enabled by default, as well as
.Cm call-fixate ,
which (if enabled) disallows any called macro to turn off localization:
like this it can be ensured that once the current scope regains control,
any changes made in deeper levels have been reverted.
The latter two are mutually exclusive, and neither affects
.Ic xcall .
The (second) argument is interpreted as a boolean (string, see
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES" )
and states whether the given attribute shall be turned on or off.

.Va \&! .
This is a character set agnostic and thus locale dependent operation,

perform plain URL percent en- and decoding, respectively.
.Ar p[ath]enc[ode]
and

perform a slightly modified operation which should be better for

.Ql ~ ,
and will neither accept hyphen-minus

as an initial character.

.
.Mx
.It Ic vexpr
\*(NQ A multiplexer command which offers signed 64-bit numeric
calculations, as well as other, mostly string-based operations.
C-style byte string operations are available via
.Ic csop .
The first argument defines the number, type, and meaning of the
remaining arguments.
An empty number argument is treated as 0.
Supports
.Cm vput
(see
.Sx "Command modifiers" ) .
The result shown in case of errors is
.Ql -1
for usage errors and numeric operations, the empty string otherwise;
.Dq soft
errors, like when a search operation failed, will also set the
.Va \&!
error number to
.Va ^ERR Ns -NODATA .
Except when otherwise noted numeric arguments are parsed as signed 64-bit
numbers, and errors will be reported in the error number
.Va \&!
as the numeric error
.Va ^ERR Ns -RANGE .
.
.Pp
Numeric operations work on one or two signed 64-bit integers.
Numbers prefixed with
.Ql 0x
or
.Ql 0X
are interpreted as hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, whereas
.Ql 0
indicates octal (base 8), and
.Ql 0b
as well as
.Ql 0B
denote binary (base 2) numbers.
It is possible to use any base in between 2 and 36, inclusive, with the
.Ql BASE#number
notation, where the base is given as an unsigned decimal number, e.g.,
.Ql 16#AFFE
is a different way of specifying a hexadecimal number.
Unsigned interpretation of a number can be enforced by prefixing an
.Ql u
(case-insensitively), e.g.,
.Ql u-110 ;
this is not necessary for power-of-two bases (2, 4, 8, 16 and 32),
which will be interpreted as unsigned by default, but it still makes
a difference regarding overflow detection and overflow constant.
It is possible to enforce signed interpretation by (instead) prefixing a
.Ql s
(case-insensitively).
The number sign notation uses a permissive parse mode and as such
supports complicated conditions out of the box:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
? wysh set ifs=:;read i;unset ifs;echo $i;vexpr pb 2 10#$i
   -009
<   -009>
0b1001
.Ed
.
.Pp
One integer is expected by assignment (equals sign
.Ql = ) ,
which does nothing but parsing the argument, thus detecting validity and
possible overflow conditions, unary not (tilde
.Ql ~ ) ,
which creates the bitwise complement, and unary plus and minus.
Two integers are used by addition (plus sign
.Ql + ) ,
subtraction (hyphen-minus
.Ql - ) ,
multiplication (asterisk
.Ql * ) ,
division (solidus
.Ql / )
and modulo (percent sign
.Ql % ) ,
as well as for the bitwise operators logical or (vertical bar
.Ql | ,
to be quoted) ,
bitwise and (ampersand
.Ql \&& ,
to be quoted) ,
bitwise xor (circumflex
.Ql ^ ) ,
the bitwise signed left- and right shifts
.Pf ( Ql << ,
.Ql >> ) ,
as well as for the unsigned right shift
.Ql >>> .
.
.Pp
Another numeric operation is
.Cm pbase ,
which takes a number base in between 2 and 36, inclusive, and will act
on the second number given just the same as what equals sign
.Ql =
does, but the number result will be formatted in the base given, as
a signed 64-bit number unless unsigned interpretation of the input
number had been forced (with an u prefix).
.
.Pp
Numeric operations support a saturated mode via the question mark
.Ql \&?
modifier suffix; the keyword
.Ql saturated
is optional, e.g.,
.Ql +?
and
.Ql +?saturated
are identical.
In saturated mode overflow errors and division and modulo by zero are no
longer reported via the exit status, but the result will linger at the
minimum or maximum possible value, instead of overflowing (or trapping).
This is true also for the argument parse step.
For the bitwise shifts, the saturated maximum is 63.
Any caught overflow will be reported via the error number
.Va \&!
as
.Va ^ERR Ns -OVERFLOW .

(w) For conventional messages the body without all headers is written.
The original message is never marked for deletion in the originating

The output is decrypted and converted to its native format as necessary.
If the output file exists, the text is appended.
If a message is in MIME multipart format its first part is written to
the specified file as for conventional messages, handling of the remains
depends on the execution mode.
No special handling of compressed files is performed.
.Pp
In interactive mode the user is consecutively asked for the filenames of
the processed parts.
For convience saving of each part may be skipped by giving an empty
value, the same result as writing it to
.Pa /dev/null .
Shell piping the part content by specifying a leading vertical bar
.Ql |
character for the filename is supported.
Other user input undergoes the usual
.Sx "Filename transformations" ,
including shell pathname wildcard pattern expansions
.Pf ( Xr glob 7 )
and shell variable expansion for the message as such, not the individual
parts, and contents of the destination file are overwritten if the file
previously existed.
.Pp
\*(ID In non-interactive mode any part which does not specify a filename
is ignored, and suspicious parts of filenames of the remaining parts are
URL percent encoded (as via

.Sh "COMMAND ESCAPES"
.
Command escapes are available in compose mode, and are used to perform
special functions when composing messages.
Command escapes are only recognized at the beginning of lines, and
consist of a trigger (escape), and a command character.
The actual escape character can be set via the internal variable
.Va escape ,
it defaults to the tilde
.Ql ~ .
Otherwise ignored whitespace characters following the escape character
will prevent a possible addition of the command line to the \*(OPal
history.
.
.Pp
Unless otherwise noted all compose mode command escapes ensure proper
updates of the variables which represent the error number
.Va \&!
and the exit status
.Va \&? .
If the variable
.Va errexit
is set they will, unless stated otherwise, error out message compose mode
and cause a program exit if an operation fails;
an effect equivalent to the command modifier
.Cm ignerr
can however be achieved by placing a hyphen-minus
.Ql -
after (possible whitespace following) the escape character.
If the \*(OPal key bindings are available it is possible to create
.Ic bind Ns

Append or edit the list of attachments.
Does not manage the error number
.Va \&!
and the exit status
.Va \&?
(please use
.Ic ~^
instead if this is a concern).
The append mode expects a list of
.Ar filename
arguments as shell tokens (see
.Sx "Shell-style argument quoting" ;
token-separating commas are ignored, too), to be
interpreted as documented for the command line option
.Fl a ,
with the message number exception as below.
.Pp
Without
.Ar filename
arguments the attachment list is edited, entry by entry;
if a filename is left empty, that attachment is deleted from the list;
once the end of the list is reached either new attachments may be
entered or the session can be quit by committing an empty
.Dq new
attachment.
In non-interactive mode or in batch mode
.Pf ( Fl # )
the list of attachments is effectively not edited but instead recreated;
again, an empty input ends list creation.
.Pp
For all modes, if a given filename solely consists of the number sign
.Ql #
followed by either a valid message number of the currently active
mailbox, or by a period
.Ql \&. ,
referring to the current message of the active mailbox, the so-called
.Dq dot ,
then the given message is attached as a

Pipe the message text through the specified filter command.
If the command gives no output or terminates abnormally,

.Pp
If the first character of the command is a vertical bar, then the entire
message including header fields is subject to the filter command, e.g.,

Does not manage the error number
.Va \&!
and the exit status
.Va \&? :
errors are handled via the protocol, and hard errors like I/O failures
cannot be handled.
The protocol consists of command lines followed by (a) response line(s).
The first field of the response line represents a status code
which specifies whether a command was successful or not, whether result
data is to be expected, and if, the format of the result data.
Error status code lines may optionally contain additional context:
.
.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width ".It Ql 210"
.It Ql 210
Status ok; the remains of the line are the result.
.
.It Ql 211
Status ok; the rest of the line is optionally used for more status.
What follows are lines of result addresses, terminated by an empty line.
All the input, including the empty line, must be consumed before further
commands can be issued.
Address lines consist of two fields, first the plain network address, e.g.,
.Ql bob@exam.ple ,
separated by a single ASCII SP space from the full address as known, e.g.,
.Ql (Lovely) Bob <bob@exam.ple> .
Non-network addresses use the first field to indicate the type (hyphen-minus
.Ql -
for files, vertical bar
.Ql |
for pipes, and number sign
.Ql #
for names which will undergo
.Ic alias
processing) instead, the actual value will be in the second field.
.
.It Ql 212
Status ok; the rest of the line is optionally used for more status.
What follows are lines of furtherly unspecified string content,
terminated by an empty line.
All the input, including the empty line, must be consumed before further
commands can be issued.
.
.It Ql 500
Syntax error; invalid command.
.
.It Ql 501
Syntax error in parameters or arguments.
.
.It Ql 505
Error: an argument fails verification.
For example an invalid address has been specified (also see
.Va expandaddr ) ,
or an attempt was made to modify anything in \*(UA's own namespace,
or a modifying subcommand has been used on a read-only message.
.
.It Ql 506
Error: an otherwise valid argument is rendered invalid due to context.
For example, a second address is added to a header which may consist of
a single address only.
.El
.
.
.Pp
If a command indicates failure then the message will have remained
unmodified.
Most commands can fail with
.Ql 500
if required arguments are missing (false command usage).
The following (case-insensitive) commands are supported:
.
.
.Bl -hang -width ".It Cm version"
.It Cm version
This command will print the protocol version via 210.
.
.It Cm header
This command allows listing, inspection, and editing of message headers.
Header name case is not normalized, and case-insensitive comparison
should be used when matching names.
The second argument specifies the subcommand to apply, one of:
.
.
.Bl -hang -width ".It Cm remove"
.It Cm list
Without a third argument a list of all yet existing headers is given via
.Ql 210 ;
this command is the default command of
.Cm header
if no second argument has been given.
A third argument restricts output to the given header only, which may
fail with
.Ql 501
if no such field is defined.
.
.It Cm show
Shows the content of the header given as the third argument.
Dependent on the header type this may respond with
.Ql 211
or
.Ql 212 ;
any failure results in
.Ql 501 .
.
.It Cm remove
This will remove all instances of the header given as the third
argument, reporting
.Ql 210
upon success,
.Ql 501
if no such header can be found, and
.Ql 505
on \*(UA namespace violations.
.
.It Cm remove-at
This will remove from the header given as the third argument the
instance at the list position (counting from one!) given with the fourth
argument, reporting
.Ql 210
upon success or
.Ql 505
if the list position argument is not a number or on \*(UA namespace
violations, and
.Ql 501
if no such header instance exists.
.
.It Cm insert
Create a new or an additional instance of the header given in the third
argument, with the header body content as given in the fourth argument
(the remains of the line).
It may return
.Ql 501
if the third argument specifies a free-form header field name that is
invalid, or if body content extraction fails to succeed,
.Ql 505
if any extracted address does not pass syntax and/or security checks or
on \*(UA namespace violations, and
.Ql 506
to indicate prevention of excessing a single-instance header \(em note that
.Ql Subject:
can be appended to (a space separator will be added automatically first).
.Pp
.Ql 210
is returned upon success, followed by the name of the header and the list
position of the newly inserted instance.
The list position is always 1 for single-instance header fields.
All free-form header fields are managed in a single list.
.El

.Ql resend .
This pseudo header always exists (in compose-mode).
.
.It Ql Mailx-Raw-To:

.El
.
.
.It Cm attachment
This command allows listing, removal and addition of message attachments.
The second argument specifies the subcommand to apply, one of:
.
.Bl -hang -width ".It Cm remove"
.It Cm list
List all attachments via
.Ql 212 ,
or report
.Ql 501
if no attachments exist.
This command is the default command of
.Cm attachment
if no second argument has been given.
.
.It Cm remove
This will remove the attachment given as the third argument, and report
.Ql 210
upon success or
.Ql 501
if no such attachment can be found.
If there exists any path component in the given argument, then an exact
match of the path which has been used to create the attachment is used
directly, but if only the basename of that path matches then all
attachments are traversed to find an exact match first, and the removal
occurs afterwards; if multiple basenames match, a
.Ql 506
error occurs.
Message attachments are treated as absolute pathnames.
.Pp
If no path component exists in the given argument, then all attachments
will be searched for
.Ql filename=
parameter matches as well as for matches of the basename of the path
which has been used when the attachment has been created; multiple
matches result in a
.Ql 506 .
.
.It Cm remove-at
This will interpret the third argument as a number and remove the
attachment at that list position (counting from one!), reporting
.Ql 210
upon success or
.Ql 505
if the argument is not a number or
.Ql 501
if no such attachment exists.
.
.It Cm insert
Adds the attachment given as the third argument, specified exactly as
documented for the command line option
.Fl a ,
and supporting the message number extension as documented for
.Ic ~@ .
This reports
.Ql 210
upon success, with the index of the new attachment following,
.Ql 505
if the given file cannot be opened,
.Ql 506
if an on-the-fly performed character set conversion fails, otherwise
.Ql 501
is reported; this is also reported if character set conversion is
requested but not available.
.
.It Cm attribute
This uses the same search mechanism as described for
.Cm remove
and prints any known attributes of the first found attachment via
.Ql 212
upon success or
.Ql 501
if no such attachment can be found.
The attributes are written as lines of keyword and value tuples, the
keyword being separated from the rest of the line with an ASCII SP space
character.
.
.It Cm attribute-at
This uses the same search mechanism as described for
.Cm remove-at
and is otherwise identical to
.Cm attribute .
.
.It Cm attribute-set
This uses the same search mechanism as described for
.Cm remove ,
and will assign the attribute given as the fourth argument, which is
expected to be a value tuple of keyword and other data, separated by
a ASCII SP space or TAB tabulator character.
If the value part is empty, then the given attribute is removed, or
reset to a default value if existence of the attribute is crucial.
.Pp
It returns via
.Ql 210
upon success, with the index of the found attachment following,
.Ql 505
for message attachments or if the given keyword is invalid, and
.Ql 501
if no such attachment can be found.
The following keywords may be used (case-insensitively):
.Pp
.Bl -hang -compact -width ".It Ql filename"
.It Ql filename
Sets the filename of the MIME part, i.e., the name that is used for
display and when (suggesting a name for) saving (purposes).
.It Ql content-description
Associate some descriptive information to the attachment's content, used
in favour of the plain filename by some MUAs.
.It Ql content-id
May be used for uniquely identifying MIME entities in several contexts;
this expects a special reference address format as defined in RFC 2045
and generates a
.Ql 505
upon address content verification failure.
.It Ql content-type
Defines the media type/subtype of the part, which is managed
automatically, but can be overwritten.
.It Ql content-disposition

.\" .Sh INTERNAL VARIABLES {{{
.Sh "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
.
Internal \*(UA variables are controlled via the
.Ic set
and
.Ic unset
commands; prefixing a variable name with the string
.Ql no
and calling
.Ic set
has the same effect as using
.Ic unset :
.Ql unset crt
and
.Ql set nocrt
do the same thing.
.Ic varshow
will give more insight on the given variable(s), and
.Ic set ,
when called without arguments, will show a listing of all variables.
Both commands support a more
.Va verbose
listing mode.
Some well-known variables will also become inherited from the
program
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
implicitly, others can be imported explicitly with the command
.Ic environ
and henceforth share said properties.
.
.Pp
Two different kinds of internal variables exist, and both of which can
also form chains.
There are boolean variables, which can only be in one of the two states
.Dq set
and
.Dq unset ,
and value variables with a(n optional) string value.
For the latter proper quoting is necessary upon assignment time, the
introduction of the section
.Sx COMMANDS
documents the supported quoting rules.
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
? wysh set one=val\e 1 two="val 2" \e
    three='val "3"' four=$'val \e'4\e''; \e
    varshow one two three four; \e
    unset one two three four
.Ed
.
.Pp
Dependent upon the actual option string values may become interpreted as
colour names, command specifications, normal text, etc.
They may be treated as numbers, in which case decimal values are
expected if so documented, but otherwise any numeric format and
base that is valid and understood by the
.Ic vexpr
command may be used, too.
.
.Pp
There also exists a special kind of string value, the
.Dq boolean string ,
which must either be a decimal integer (in which case
.Ql 0
is false and
.Ql 1
and any other value is true) or any of the (case-insensitive) strings
.Ql off ,
.Ql no ,
.Ql n
and
.Ql false
for a false boolean and
.Ql on ,
.Ql yes ,
.Ql y
and
.Ql true
for a true boolean; a special kind of boolean string is the
.Dq quadoption ,
which is a boolean string that can optionally be prefixed with the
(case-insensitive) term
.Ql ask- ,
as in
.Ql ask-yes ,
which causes prompting of the user in interactive mode, with the given
boolean as the default value.
.
.Pp
Variable chains extend a plain
.Ql variable
with
.Ql variable-HOST
and
.Ql variable-USER@HOST
variants.
Here
.Ql HOST
will be converted to all lowercase when looked up (but not when the
variable is set or unset!), \*(OPally IDNA converted, and indeed means
.Ql server:port
if a
.Ql port
had been specified in the contextual Uniform Resource Locator URL, see
.Sx "On URL syntax and credential lookup" .
Even though this mechanism is based on URLs no URL percent encoding may
be applied to neither of
.Ql USER
nor
.Ql HOST ,
variable chains need to be specified using raw data;
the mentioned section contains examples.
Variables which support chains are explicitly documented as such, and
\*(UA treats the base name of any such variable special, meaning that
users should not create custom names like
.Ql variable-xyz
in order to avoid false classifications and treatment of such variables.

.
.Mx
.It Va escape
The first character of this value defines the escape character for
.Sx "COMMAND ESCAPES"

The default value is the character tilde
.Ql ~ .
If set to the empty string, command escapes are disabled.
.
.
.Mx
.It Va expandaddr
If unset then file and command pipeline address targets are not allowed,
and any such address will be filtered out, giving a warning message.
If set then all possible recipient address specifications will be
accepted, unless the optional value is more specific (also see
.Sx "On sending mail, and non-interactive mode" ) .
If the value contains
.Ql restrict
then behaviour equals the former unless in interactive mode, or when
tilde commands were enabled explicitly via
.Fl ~
or
.Fl # ,
in which case it equals the latter, and thus allows all addressees.
.Ql restrict
really acts like
.Ql restrict,\:-all,\:+name,\:+addr ,
so care for ordering issues must be taken.
.
.Pp
Indeed the value is interpreted as a comma-separated list of
case-insensitive strings.
Presence of forbidden address types is treated as a hard send error
instead of only causing them to be filtered out if the list contains
.Ql fail .
Address targets can be added and subtracted with a plus sign
.Ql +
or hyphen-minus
.Ql -
prefix: the value
.Ql all
addresses all possible address specifications,
.Ql fcc
whitelists targets specified via
.Ql Fcc:
headers regardless of other settings,
.Ql file
file targets (it includes
.Ql fcc ) ,
.Ql pipe
command pipeline targets,
.Ql name
plain user names and (MTA) aliases and
.Ql addr
network addresses;
Targets are interpreted in the given order, so that
.Ql restrict,\:fail,\:+file,\:-all,\:+addr
will cause hard errors for any non-network address recipient address
unless running interactively or having been started with the option
.Fl ~
or
.Fl # ;
in the latter case(s) any address may be used, then.
.
.Pp
Historically invalid network addressees were silently stripped off \(em
shall they cause hard errors instead it must be ensured that
.Ql failinvaddr
is an entry of the list (it really acts like
.Ql failinvaddr,\:+addr ) .
Likewise,
.Ql domaincheck
.Pf (actually\0\: Ql domaincheck,\:+addr )
compares address domain names against a whitelist and strips off
.Pf ( Ql fail
for hard errors) addressees which fail this test; the domain name
.Ql localhost
and the non-empty value of
.Va hostname
(the real hostname otherwise) are always whitelisted,
.Va expandaddr-domaincheck
can be set to extend this list.
Finally some address providers (for example
.Fl b , c
and all recipients given on the command line) will be will evaluated as
if specified within dollar-single-quotes (see
.Sx "Shell-style argument quoting" )
if the value list contains the string
.Ql shquote .
.
.
.Mx
.It Va expandaddr-domaincheck
Can be set to a comma-separated list of domain names which should be
whitelisted for the evaluation of the
.Ql domaincheck
mode of
.Va expandaddr .
IDNA encoding is not automatically performed,
.Ic addrcodec
can be used to prepare the domain (of an address).
.
.Mx
.It Va expandargv
Unless this variable is set additional
.Va mta
(Mail-Transfer-Agent)
arguments from the command line, as can be given after a
.Fl \&\&-
separator, results in a program termination with failure status.
The same can be accomplished by using the special (case-insensitive) value
.Ql fail .
A lesser strict variant is the otherwise identical

The macro will also be invoked when new mail arrives,
but message lists for commands executed from the macro
only include newly arrived messages then.
.Ic localopts
are activated by default in a folder hook, causing the covered settings
to be reverted once the folder is left again.
.Pp
The specialized form will override the generic one if
.Ql FOLDER
matches the file that is opened.
Unlike other folder specifications, the fully expanded name of a folder,
without metacharacters, is used to avoid ambiguities.
However, if the mailbox resides under

.It Va headline-bidi
Bidirectional text requires special treatment when displaying headers,
because numbers (in dates or for file sizes etc.) will not affect the
current text direction, in effect resulting in ugly line layouts when
arabic or other right-to-left text is to be displayed.
On the other hand only a minority of terminals is capable to correctly
handle direction changes, so that user interaction is necessary for
acceptable results.
Note that extended host system support is required nonetheless, e.g.,
detection of the terminal character set is one precondition;
and this feature only works in an Unicode (i.e., UTF-8) locale.
.Pp
In general setting this variable will cause \*(UA to encapsulate text
fields that may occur when displaying
.Va headline
(and some other fields, like dynamic expansions in
.Va prompt )
with special Unicode control sequences;
it is possible to fine-tune the terminal support level by assigning
a value:
no value (or any value other than
.Ql 1 ,
.Ql 2
and
.Ql 3 )
will make \*(UA assume that the terminal is capable to properly deal
with Unicode version 6.3, in which case text is embedded in a pair of
U+2068 (FIRST STRONG ISOLATE) and U+2069 (POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE)
characters.
In addition no space on the line is reserved for these characters.
.Pp
Weaker support is chosen by using the value
.Ql 1
(Unicode 6.3, but reserve the room of two spaces for writing the control
sequences onto the line).
The values
.Ql 2
and
.Ql 3
select Unicode 1.1 support (U+200E, LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK); the latter
again reserves room for two spaces in addition.

header fields that some MUAs generate by setting this variable.
Since \*(UA does neither use nor update these non-standardized header
fields (which in itself shows one of their conceptual problems),
stripping them should increase interoperability in between MUAs that
work with with same mailbox files.
Note that, if this is not set but

If this variable is unset then a plain standalone RFC 5322 message will
be written, and existing file targets will be overwritten.
.
.Mx
.It Va mbox-rfc4155
\*(BO When opening MBOX mailbox databases \*(UA by default uses tolerant
POSIX rules for detecting message boundaries (so-called
.Ql From_
lines) due to compatibility reasons, instead of the stricter rules that
have been standardized in RFC 4155.
This behaviour can be switched to the stricter RFC 4155 rules by
setting this variable.
.Pp
This may temporarily be handy when \*(UA complains about invalid
.Ql From_
lines when opening a MBOX: in this case setting this variable and
re-opening the mailbox in question may correct the result.
If so, copying the entire mailbox to some other file, as in
.Ql copy * SOME-FILE ,
will perform proper, all-compatible

\*(BO Usually, when an

expansion contains the sender, the sender is removed from the expansion.
Setting this option suppresses these removals.
Note that a set

also causes a

this flag, no MTA is known which does not support it (for historical
compatibility).
.

\*(BO When sending messages, each part of the message is MIME-inspected
in order to classify the

that is required to send this part over mail transport, i.e.,
a computation rather similar to what the
.Xr file 1
command produces when used with the
.Ql --mime
option.
.Pp
This classification however treats text files which are encoded in
UTF-16 (seen for HTML files) and similar character sets as binary
octet-streams, forcefully changing any
.Ql text/plain
or
.Ql text/html
specification to
.Ql application/octet-stream :
If that actually happens a yet unset charset MIME parameter is set to
.Ql binary ,
effectively making it impossible for the receiving MUA to automatically
interpret the contents of the part.
.Pp
If this variable is set, and the data was unambiguously identified as
text data at first glance (by a
.Ql .txt
or
.Ql .html
file extension), then the original
.Ql Content-Type:
will not be overwritten.
.
.Mx
.It Va mime-alternative-favour-rich
\*(BO If this variable is set then rich MIME alternative parts (e.g.,
HTML) will be preferred in favour of included plain text versions when
displaying messages, provided that a handler exists which produces
output that can be (re)integrated into \*(UA's normal visual display.
(E.g., at the time of this writing some newsletters ship their full
content only in the rich HTML part, whereas the plain text part only
contains topic subjects.)
.

.It Va mime-counter-evidence
Normally the

Some MUAs, however, do not use

(also see
.Sx "HTML mail and MIME attachments" )
or a similar mechanism to correctly classify content, but specify an
unspecific MIME type
.Pf ( Ql application/octet-stream )
even for plain text attachments.
If this variable is set then \*(UA will try to re-classify such MIME
message parts, if possible, for example via a possibly existing
attachment filename.
A non-empty value may also be given, in which case a number is expected,
actually a carrier of bits, best specified as a binary value, e.g.,

.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
If bit two is set (counting from 1, decimal 2) then the detected

will be carried along with the message and be used for deciding which
MIME handler is to be used, for example;
when displaying such a MIME part the part-info will indicate the
overridden content-type by showing a plus sign
.Ql + .
.It
If bit three is set (decimal 4) then the counter-evidence is always
produced and a positive result will be used as the MIME type, even
forcefully overriding the parts given MIME type.
.It
If bit four is set (decimal 8) as a last resort the actual content of
.Ql application/octet-stream
parts will be inspected, so that data which looks like plain text can be
treated as such.
This mode is even more relaxed when data is to be displayed to the user
or used as a message quote (data consumers which mangle data for display
purposes, which includes masking of control characters, for example).

.It Ql 8bit
.Pf (Or\0 Ql 8b . )
8-bit transport effectively causes the raw data be passed through
unchanged, but may cause problems when transferring mail messages over
channels that are not ESMTP (RFC 1869) compliant.
Also, several input data constructs are not allowed by the
specifications and may cause a different transfer-encoding to be used.
By established rules and popular demand occurrances of
.Ql ^From_

will be MBOXO quoted (prefixed with greater-than sign
.Ql > )
instead of causing a non-destructive encoding like
.Ql quoted-printable
to be chosen, unless context (e.g., message signing) requires otherwise.
.
.It Ql quoted-printable
.Pf (Or\0 Ql qp . )
Quoted-printable encoding is 7-bit clean and has the property that ASCII
characters are passed through unchanged, so that an english message can
be read as-is; it is also acceptable for other single-byte locales that
share many characters with ASCII, like, e.g., ISO-8859-1.
The encoding will cause a large overhead for messages in other character
sets: e.g., it will require up to twelve (12) bytes to encode a single
UTF-8 character of four (4) bytes.
It is the default encoding.
.
.It Ql base64
.Pf (Or\0 Ql b64 . )
This encoding is 7-bit clean and will always be used for binary data.
This encoding has a constant input:output ratio of 3:4, regardless of
the character set of the input data it will encode three bytes of input
to four bytes of output.
This transfer-encoding is not human readable without performing

If this variable is not set \*(UA will try to load both files.
Incorporation of the \*(UA-built-in MIME types cannot be suppressed,
but they will be matched last (the order can be listed via
.Ic mimetype ) .
.Pp
More sources can be specified by using a different syntax: if the

.Ql =
then it is instead parsed as a comma-separated list of the described
letters plus
.Ql f=FILENAME
pairs; the given filenames will be expanded and loaded, and their
content may use the extended syntax that is described in the section
.Sx "The mime.types files" .
Directives found in such files always take precedence (are prepended to
the MIME type cache).

.It Va mta
To choose an alternate Mail-Transfer-Agent, set this option to either
the full pathname of an executable (optionally prefixed with the protocol
.Ql file:// ) ,
or \*(OPally a SMTP a.k.a. SUBMISSION protocol URL, e.g., \*(IN
.Pp
.Dl submissions://[user[:password]@]server[:port]
.Pp
(\*(OU:
.Ql [smtp://]server[:port] . )
The default has been chosen at compile time.
All supported data transfers are executed in child processes, which
run asynchronously and without supervision unless either the
.Va sendwait
or the
.Va verbose
variable is set.
If such a child receives a TERM signal, it will abort and
.Va save
the message to

if so configured.
.
.Pp
For a file-based MTA it may be necessary to set
.Va mta-argv0
in in order to choose the right target of a modern
.Xr mailwrapper 8
environment.
It will be passed command line arguments from several possible sources:
from the variable
.Va mta-arguments
if set, from the command line if given and the variable
.Va expandargv
allows their use.
Argument processing of the MTA will be terminated with a
.Fl \&\&-
separator.
.
.Pp
The otherwise occurring implicit usage of the following MTA command
line arguments can be disabled by setting the boolean variable
.Va mta-no-default-arguments
(which will also disable passing
.Fl \&\&-
to the MTA):
.Fl \&\&i
(for not treating a line with only a dot
.Ql \&.
character as the end of input),
.Fl \&\&m
(shall the variable
.Va metoo
be set) and
.Fl \&\&v
(if the
.Va verbose
variable is set); in conjunction with the
.Fl r
command line option \*(UA will also (not) pass
.Fl \&\&f
as well as possibly
.Fl \&\&F .
.
.Pp
\*(OPally \*(UA can send mail over SMTP a.k.a. SUBMISSION network
connections to a single defined smart host by setting this variable to
a SMTP or SUBMISSION URL (see
.Sx "On URL syntax and credential lookup" ) .
An authentication scheme can be specified via the variable chain
.Va smtp-auth .
Encrypted network connections are \*(OPally available, the section
.Sx "Encrypted network communication"
should give an overview and provide links to more information on this.
Note that with some mail providers it may be necessary to set the
.Va smtp-hostname
variable in order to use a specific combination of
.Va from ,
.Va hostname
and
.Va mta .
Network communication socket timeouts are configurable, e.g.,
.Va socket-connect-timeout .
All generated network traffic may be proxied over the SOCKS5 server given in
.Va socks-proxy .
The following SMTP variants may be used:
.
.Bl -bullet
.It
The plain SMTP protocol (RFC 5321) that normally lives on the
server port 25 and requires setting the
.Va smtp-use-starttls
variable to enter a TLS encrypted session state.
Assign a value like \*(IN
.Ql smtp://[user[:password]@]server[:port]
(\*(OU
.Ql smtp://server[:port] )
to choose this protocol.
.It
The so-called SMTPS which is supposed to live on server port 465
and is automatically TLS secured.
Unfortunately it never became a standardized protocol and may thus not
be supported by your hosts network service database
\(en in fact the port number has already been reassigned to other
protocols!
.Pp
SMTPS is nonetheless a commonly offered protocol and thus can be
chosen by assigning a value like \*(IN
.Ql smtps://[user[:password]@]server[:port]
(\*(OU
.Ql smtps://server[:port] ) ;
due to the mentioned problems it is usually necessary to explicitly
specify the port as
.Ql :465 ,
however.
.It
The SUBMISSION protocol (RFC 6409) lives on server port 587 and
is identically to the SMTP protocol from \*(UA's point of view;
it requires setting
.Va smtp-use-starttls
to enter a TLS secured session state; e.g., \*(IN
.Ql submission://[user[:password]@]server[:port] .
.It
The SUBMISSIONS protocol (RFC 8314) that lives on server port 465 and is
TLS secured by default.
It can be chosen by assigning a value like \*(IN
.Ql submissions://[user[:password]@]server[:port] .
Due to the problems mentioned for SMTPS above and the fact that
SUBMISSIONS is new and a successor that lives on the same port as the
historical engineering mismanagement named SMTPS, it is usually
necessary to explicitly specify the port as
.Ql :465 .

.Mx
.It Va mta-arguments
Arguments to pass through to a file-based
.Va mta
can be given via this variable, which is parsed according to
.Sx "Shell-style argument quoting"
into an array of arguments, and which will be joined onto MTA options
from other sources, and then passed individually to the MTA:
.Ql \&? wysh set mta-arguments='-t -X \&"/tmp/my log\&"' .
.
.Mx
.It Va mta-no-default-arguments
\*(BO Unless this variable is set \*(UA will pass some well known
standard command line options to a file-based

\*(BO By default a file-based
.Va mta
will be passed all receiver addresses on the command line.
This variable can be set to suppress any such argument.
.
.Mx
.It Va mta-argv0
Many systems use a so-called
.Xr mailwrapper 8
environment to ensure compatibility with
.Xr sendmail 1 .
This works by inspecting the name that was used to invoke the mail
delivery system.
If this variable is set then the mailwrapper (the program that is
actually executed when calling the file-based
.Va mta )
will treat its contents as that name.
.

.
.Mx
.It Va netrc-pipe
\*(IN\*(OP When

.Ql \&? set netrc-pipe='gpg -qd ~/.netrc.pgp' .
.
.Mx
.It Va newfolders
\*(OP If this variable has the value

.It Va newmail
Checks for new mail in the current folder each time the prompt is shown.
A Maildir folder must be re-scanned to determine if new mail has arrived.
If this variable is set to the special value

then a Maildir folder will not be rescanned completely, but only
timestamp changes are detected.
Maildir folders are \*(OPal.

.Mx
.It Va on-compose-splice , on-compose-splice-shell
These hooks run once the normal compose mode is finished, but before the
.Va on-compose-leave
macro hook is called etc.
Both hooks will be executed in a subprocess, with their input and output
connected to \*(UA such that they can act as if they would be an
interactive user.
The difference in between them is that the latter is a
.Ev SHELL
command, whereas the former is a normal
.Ic define Ns
d macro, but which is restricted to a small set of commands (the
.Va verbose
output of, e.g.,
.Ic list
will indicate said capability).
.Ic localopts
are enabled for these hooks (in the parent process), causing any setting
to be forgotten after the message has been sent;
.Va on-compose-cleanup
can be used to perform other cleanup as necessary.
.
.Pp
During execution of these hooks \*(UA will temporarily forget whether it
has been started in interactive mode, (a restricted set of)
.Sx "COMMAND ESCAPES"
will always be available, and for guaranteed reproducibilities sake
.Va escape
and
.Va ifs
will be set to their defaults.
The compose mode command
.Ic ~^
has been especially designed for scriptability (via these hooks).
The first line the hook will read on its standard input is the protocol
version of said command escape, currently
.Dq 0 0 1 :
backward incompatible protocol changes have to be expected.
.
.Pp
Care must be taken to avoid deadlocks and other false control flow:
if both involved processes wait for more input to happen at the
same time, or one does not expect more input but the other is stuck
waiting for consumption of its output, etc.
There is no automatic synchronization of the hook: it will not be
stopped automatically just because it, e.g., emits
.Ql ~x .
The hooks will however receive a termination signal if the parent enters
an error condition.
\*(ID Protection against and interaction with signals is not yet given;
it is likely that in the future these scripts will be placed in an
isolated session, which is signalled in its entirety as necessary.

its text is filtered through the value of this variable interpreted as
a shell command.
Note that only parts which can be displayed inline as plain text (see
.Cd copiousoutput )
are displayed unless otherwise noted, other MIME parts will only be
considered by and for the command
.Ic mimeview .
.
.Pp
The special value question mark
.Ql \&?
forces interpretation of the message part as plain text, e.g.,
.Ql set pipe-application/xml=?
will henceforth display XML

is not, then \*(UA acts as if
.Va sendcharsets
had been set to the value of the variable

In effect this combination passes through the message data in the

therefore mail message text will be (assumed to be) in ISO-8859-1
encoding when send from within a ISO-8859-1 locale, and in UTF-8
encoding when send from within an UTF-8 locale.
.Pp
The 8-bit fallback
.Va charset-8bit
never comes into play as
.Va ttycharset
is implicitly assumed to be 8-bit and capable to represent all files the
user may specify (as is the case when no character set conversion
support is available in \*(UA and the only supported character set is
.Va ttycharset :
.Sx "Character sets" ) .
This might be a problem for scripts which use the suggested

.Pp
If a message is sent to multiple recipients,
each of them for whom a corresponding variable is set will receive an

Signing a message enables a recipient to verify that the sender used
a valid certificate,
that the email addresses in the certificate match those in the message
header and that the message content has not been altered.
It does not change the message text,
and people will be able to read the message as usual.

.Mx Va smime-sign-cert
.It Va smime-sign-cert-USER@HOST , smime-sign-cert
\*(OP Points to a file in PEM format.
For the purpose of signing and decryption this file needs to contain the
user's private key, followed by his certificate.
.Pp
For message signing
.Ql USER@HOST
is always derived from the value of
.Va from
(or, if that contains multiple addresses,
.Va sender ) .
For the purpose of encryption the recipient's public encryption key
(certificate) is expected; the command
.Ic certsave
can be used to save certificates of signed messages (the section
.Sx "Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME"
gives some details).
This mode of operation is usually driven by the specialized form.
.Pp
When decrypting messages the account is derived from the recipient
fields
.Pf ( Ql To:
and
.Ql Cc: )
of the message, which are searched for addresses for which such
a variable is set.
\*(UA always uses the first address that matches,
so if the same message is sent to more than one of the user's addresses
using different encryption keys, decryption might fail.
.Pp
For signing and decryption purposes it is possible to use encrypted
keys, and the pseudo-host(s)
.Ql USER@HOST.smime-cert-key
for the private key
(and
.Ql USER@HOST.smime-cert-cert
for the certificate stored in the same file)
will be used for performing any necessary password lookup,
therefore the lookup can be automated via the mechanisms described in
.Sx "On URL syntax and credential lookup" .
For example, the hypothetical address
.Ql bob@exam.ple
could be driven with a private key / certificate pair path defined in
.Va \&\&smime-sign-cert-bob@exam.ple ,
and needed passwords would then be looked up via the pseudo hosts
.Ql bob@exam.ple.smime-cert-key
(and
.Ql bob@exam.ple.smime-cert-cert ) .

.It Va smime-sign-digest-USER@HOST , smime-sign-digest
\*(OP Specifies the message digestto use when signing S/MIME messages.
Please remember that for this use case
.Ql USER@HOST
refers to the variable
.Va from
(or, if that contains multiple addresses,
.Va sender ) .
The available algorithms depend on the used cryptographic library, but
at least one usable builtin algorithm is ensured as a default.
If possible the standard RFC 5751 will be violated by using
.Ql SHA512
instead of the mandated
.Ql SHA1
due to security concerns.
.Pp
\*(UA will try to add built-in support for the following message

of files, each of which containing a single certificate in PEM format to
be included in the S/MIME message in addition to the
.Va smime-sign-cert
certificate.
This can be used to include intermediate certificates of the certificate
authority, in order to allow the receiver's S/MIME implementation to
perform a verification of the entire certificate chain, starting from
a local root certificate, over the intermediate certificates, down to the
.Va smime-sign-cert .
Even though top level certificates may also be included in the chain,
they won't be used for the verification on the receiver's side.

If only set without an assigned value, then this setting inhibits the
generation of the

.Ql Content-ID:
and
.Ql User-Agent:
header fields that include obvious references to \*(UA.
There are two pitfalls associated with this:
First, the message id of outgoing messages is not known anymore.
Second, an expert may still use the remaining information in the header
to track down the originating mail user agent.
If set to the value

.Sy Note
this variable will only be queried once at program startup and can

.
.Pp
String capabilities form
.Ql cap=value
pairs and are expected unless noted otherwise.
Numerics have to be notated as
.Ql cap#number
where the number is expected in normal decimal notation.
Finally, booleans do not have any value but indicate a true or false
state simply by being defined or not; this indeed means that \*(UA
does not support undefining an existing boolean.
String capability values will undergo some expansions before use:
for one notations like
.Ql ^LETTER
stand for
.Ql control-LETTER ,
and for clarification purposes
.Ql \eE
can be used to specify
.Ql escape
(the control notation
.Ql ^[
could lead to misreadings when a left bracket follows, which it does for
the standard CSI sequence);
finally three letter octal sequences, as in
.Ql \e061 ,
are supported.
To specify that a terminal supports 256-colours, and to define sequences
that home the cursor and produce an audible bell, one might write:
.

.It Cd no-check-time
Do not check certificate/CRL validity against current time.
.It Cd partial-chain

With this flag set, a chain succeeds to verify if at least one signing
certificate of the chain is in any of the configured trusted stores of

.
The term
.Dq environment variable
should be considered an indication that these variables are either
standardized as vivid parts of process environments, or that they are
commonly found in there.
The process environment is inherited from the
.Xr sh 1
once \*(UA is started, and unless otherwise explicitly noted handling of
the following variables transparently integrates into that of the
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
from \*(UA's point of view.
This means that, e.g., they can be managed via
.Ic set
and
.Ic unset ,
causing automatic program environment updates (to be inherited by
newly created child processes).
.
.Pp
In order to integrate other environment variables equally they need to
be imported (linked) with the command
.Ic environ .
This command can also be used to set and unset non-integrated
environment variables from scratch, sufficient system support provided.
The following example, applicable to a POSIX shell, sets the
.Ev COLUMNS
environment variable for \*(UA only, and beforehand exports the
.Ev EDITOR

Queried and used once on program startup in interactive or batch

Non-interactive mode always uses, and the fallback default is
a compile-time constant, by default 80 columns.
If in batch mode
.Ev \&\&COLUMNS

RFC 1524 defines a
.Dq User Agent Configuration Mechanism
which \*(UA \*(OPally supports (see
.Sx "HTML mail and MIME attachments" ) .
It defines a file format to be used to inform mail user agent programs
about the locally-installed facilities for handling various data
formats, i.e., about commands and how they can be used to display, edit
et cetera MIME part contents, as well as a default path search that
includes multiple possible locations of
.Dq mailcap
files and the
.Ev MAILCAPS
environment variable that can be used to overwrite that (repeating here
that it is not a search path, but instead a path search specification).
Any existing files will be loaded in sequence, appending any content to
the list of MIME type handler directives.
.
.Pp
.Dq Mailcap
files consist of a set of newline separated entries.
Comment lines start with a number sign
.Ql #
(in the first column!) and are ignored.
Empty lines are also ignored.
All other lines form individual entries that must adhere to the syntax
described below.
To extend a single entry (not comment) its line can be continued on
follow lines if newline characters are
.Dq escaped
by preceding them with the reverse solidus character
.Ql \e .
The standard does not specify how leading whitespace of follow lines
is to be treated, therefore \*(UA retains it.
.
.Pp
.Dq Mailcap
entries consist of a number of semicolon
.Ql \&;
separated fields, and the reverse solidus
.Ql \e
character can be used to escape any following character including
semicolon and itself.
The first two fields are mandatory and must occur in the specified
order, the remaining fields are optional and may appear in any order.
Leading and trailing whitespace of content is ignored (removed).
.
.Pp
The first field defines the MIME
.Ql TYPE/SUBTYPE
the entry is about to handle (case-insensitively, and no reverse solidus
escaping is possible in this field).
If the subtype is specified as an asterisk
.Ql *
the entry is meant to match all subtypes of the named type, e.g.,
.Ql audio/*
would match any audio type.
The second field defines the shell command which shall be used to
.Dq display
MIME parts of the given type; it is implicitly called the
.Cd view
command.
.
.Pp
For data
.Dq consuming
shell commands message (MIME part) data is passed via standard input
unless the given shell command includes one or more instances of the
(unquoted) string
.Ql %s ,
in which case these instances will be replaced with a temporary filename
and the data will have been stored in the file that is being pointed to.
Likewise, for data
.Dq producing
shell commands data is assumed to be generated on standard output unless
the given command includes (one ore multiple)
.Ql %s .
In any case any given
.Ql %s
format is replaced with a(n already) properly quoted filename.
Note that when a command makes use of a temporary file via
.Ql %s
then \*(UA will remove it again, as if the
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile ,
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-fill
and
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-unlink
flags had been set; see below for more.
.
.Pp
The optional fields either define a shell command or an attribute (flag)
value, the latter being a single word and the former being a keyword
naming the field followed by an equals sign
.Ql =
succeeded by a shell command, and as usual for any
.Dq Mailcap
content any whitespace surrounding the equals sign will be removed, too.
Optional fields include the following:
.
.
.Bl -tag -width ".It Cd BaNg"
.It Cd compose
A program that can be used to compose a new body or body part in the
given format.
(Currently unused.)
.
.It Cd composetyped
Similar to the

.It Cd edit
A program that can be used to edit a body or body part in the given
format.
(Currently unused.)
.
.It Cd print
A program that can be used to print a message or body part in the given
format.
(Currently unused.)
.
.It Cd test
Specifies a program to be run to test some condition, e.g., the machine
architecture, or the window system in use, to determine whether or not
this mailcap entry applies.
If the test fails, a subsequent mailcap entry should be sought; also see
.Cd x-mailx-test-once .
.
.Mx
.It Cd needsterminal
This flag field indicates that the given shell command must be run on
an interactive terminal.
\*(UA will temporarily release the terminal to the given command in
interactive mode, in non-interactive mode this entry will be entirely
ignored; this flag implies
.Cd x-mailx-noquote .
.
.Mx
.It Cd copiousoutput
A flag field which indicates that the output of the
.Cd view
command will be an extended stream of textual output that can be
(re)integrated into \*(UA's normal visual display.
It is mutually exclusive with
.Cd needsterminal .
.
.It Cd textualnewlines
A flag field which indicates that this type of data is line-oriented and
that, if encoded in
.Ql base64 ,
all newlines should be converted to canonical form (CRLF) before
encoding, and will be in that form after decoding.
(Currently unused.)
.
.It Cd nametemplate
This field gives a filename format, in which
.Ql %s
will be replaced by a random string, the joined combination of which
will be used as the filename denoted by
.Ev MAILX_FILENAME_TEMPORARY .
One could specify that a GIF file being passed to an image viewer should
have a name ending in
.Ql .gif
by using
.Ql nametemplate=%s.gif .
Note that \*(UA ignores the name template unless that solely specifies
a filename suffix that consists of (ASCII) alphabetic and numeric
characters, the underscore and dot only.
.
.It Cd x11-bitmap
Names a file, in X11 bitmap (xbm) format, which points to an appropriate

.Cd needsterminal .
.
.Mx
.It Cd x-mailx-test-once
Extension flag which denotes whether the given

command shall be evaluated once only and the (boolean) result be cached.
This is handy if some global unchanging condition is to be queried, like
.Dq running under the X Window System .
.
.Mx
.It Cd x-mailx-tmpfile
Extension flag field that requests creation of a zero-sized temporary
file, the name of which is to be placed in the environment variable
.Ev MAILX_FILENAME_TEMPORARY .
It is an error to use this flag with commands that include a
.Ql %s
format.
.
.Mx
.It Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-fill
Normally the MIME part content is passed to the handler via standard
input; if this flag is set then the data will instead be written into
the implied
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile .
In order to cause deletion of the temporary file you will have to set
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-unlink
explicitly!
It is an error to use this flag with commands that include a
.Ql %s
format.
.
.Mx
.It Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-unlink
Extension flag field that requests that the temporary file shall be
deleted automatically when the command loop is entered again at latest.
(Do not use this for asynchronous handlers.)
It is an error to use this flag with commands that include a
.Ql %s
format, or in conjunction with
.Cd x-mailx-async ,
or without also setting
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile
or
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-fill .
.
.Mx
.It Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-keep
Using the string
.Ql %s
implies the three tmpfile related flags above, but if you want, e.g.,
.Cd x-mailx-async
and deal with the temporary file yourself, you can add in this flag to
forcefully ignore
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-unlink .

\*(OP The first thing that is needed for
.Sx "Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME"
is a personal certificate, and a private key.
The certificate contains public information, in particular a name and
email address(es), and the public key that can be used by others to
encrypt messages for the certificate holder (the owner of the private
key), and to
.Ic verify
signed messages generated with that certificate('s private key).
Whereas the certificate is included in each signed message, the private
key must be kept secret.
It is used to decrypt messages that were previously encrypted with the
public key, and to sign messages.
.
.Pp
For personal use it is recommended that get a S/MIME certificate from
one of the major CAs on the Internet.
Many CAs offer such certificates for free.
Usually offered is a combined certificate and private key in PKCS#12
format which \*(UA does not accept directly.
To convert it to PEM format, the following shell command can be used;
please read on for how to use these PEM files.
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out certpem.pem -clcerts -nodes

.Ed
.
.Pp
There is also
.Lk https://www.CAcert.org
which issues client and server certificates to members of their
community for free; their root certificate
.Pf ( Lk https://\:www.cacert.org/\:certs/\:root.crt )
is often not in the default set of trusted CA root certificates, though,
which means their root certificate has to be downloaded separately,
and needs to be part of the S/MIME certificate validation chain by
including it in
.Va smime-ca-dir
or as a vivid member of the
.Va smime-ca-file .
But let us take a step-by-step tour on how to setup S/MIME with
a certificate from CAcert.org despite this situation!
.
.Pp
First of all you will have to become a member of the CAcert.org
community, simply by registrating yourself via the web interface.
Once you are, create and verify all email addresses you want to be able
to create signed and encrypted messages for/with using the corresponding
entries of the web interface.
Now ready to create S/MIME certificates, so let us create a new
.Dq client certificate ,
ensure to include all email addresses that should be covered by the
certificate in the following web form, and also to use your name as the
.Dq common name .
.
.Pp
Create a private key and a certificate request on your local computer
(please see the manual pages of the used commands for more in-depth
knowledge on what the used arguments etc. do):
.
.Pp
.Dl $ openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out creq.pem
.
.Pp
Afterwards copy-and-paste the content of
.Dq creq.pem
into the certificate-request (CSR) field of the web form on the
CAcert.org website (you may need to unfold some
.Dq advanced options
to see the corresponding text field).
This last step will ensure that your private key (which never left your
box) and the certificate belong together (through the public key that
will find its way into the certificate via the certificate-request).
You are now ready and can create your CAcert certified certificate.
Download and store or copy-and-paste it as
.Dq pub.crt .
.
.Pp
Yay.
In order to use your new S/MIME setup a combined private key/public key
(certificate) file has to be created:
.
.Pp
.Dl $ cat key.pem pub.crt > ME@HERE.com.paired
.
.Pp
This is the file \*(UA will work with.
If you have created your private key with a passphrase then \*(UA will
ask you for it whenever a message is signed or decrypted, unless this
operation has been automated as described in
.Sx "Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME" .
Set the following variables to henceforth use S/MIME (setting
.Va smime-ca-file
is of interest for verification only):
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
? set smime-ca-file=ALL-TRUSTED-ROOT-CERTS-HERE \e

.Ss "Using CRLs with S/MIME or TLS"
.
\*(OP Certification authorities (CAs) issue certificate revocation
lists (CRLs) on a regular basis.
These lists contain the serial numbers of certificates that have been
declared invalid after they have been issued.
Such usually happens because the private key for the certificate has
been compromised,
because the owner of the certificate has left the organization that is
mentioned in the certificate, etc.
To seriously use S/MIME or TLS verification,
an up-to-date CRL is required for each trusted CA.
There is otherwise no method to distinguish between valid and
invalidated certificates.
\*(UA currently offers no mechanism to fetch CRLs, nor to access them on
the Internet, so they have to be retrieved by some external mechanism.
.
.Pp
\*(UA accepts CRLs in PEM format only;
CRLs in DER format must be converted, like, e.\|g.:
.
.Pp
.Dl $ openssl crl \-inform DER \-in crl.der \-out crl.pem
.
.Pp
To tell \*(UA about the CRLs, a directory that contains all CRL files
(and no other files) must be created.
The
.Va smime-crl-dir
or
.Va tls-crl-dir
variables, respectively, must then be set to point to that directory.
After that, \*(UA requires a CRL to be present for each CA that is used
to verify a certificate.

\*(OPally there is IMAP client support available.
This part of the program is obsolete and will vanish in v15 with the
large MIME and I/O layer rewrite, because it uses old-style blocking I/O
and makes excessive use of signal based long code jumps.
Support can hopefully be readded later based on a new-style I/O, with
SysV signal handling.
In fact the IMAP support had already been removed from the codebase, but
was reinstantiated on user demand: in effect the IMAP code is at the
level of \*(UA v14.8.16 (with
.Ic imapcodec
being the sole exception), and should be treated with some care.
.
.Pp
IMAP uses the
.Ql imap://
and
.Ql imaps://
protocol prefixes, and an IMAP-based
.Va folder
may be used.
IMAP URLs (paths) undergo inspections and possible transformations
before use (and the command
.Ic imapcodec
can be used to manually apply them to any given argument).
Hierarchy delimiters are normalized, a step which is configurable via the
.Va imap-delim
variable chain, but defaults to the first seen delimiter otherwise.
\*(UA supports internationalised IMAP names, and en- and decodes the
names from and to the
.Va ttycharset
as necessary and possible.
If a mailbox name is expanded (see
.Sx "Filename transformations" )
to an IMAP mailbox, all names that begin with `+' then refer to IMAP
mailboxes below the
.Va folder
target box, while folder names prefixed by `@' refer to folders below
the hierarchy base, e.g., the following lists all folders below the
current one when in an IMAP mailbox:
.Ql folders @ .
.
.Pp
Note: some IMAP servers do not accept the creation of mailboxes in
the hierarchy base, but require that they are created as subfolders of
`INBOX' \(en with such servers a folder name of the form
.Pp
.Dl imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example/INBOX.
.Pp
should be used (the last character is the server's hierarchy
delimiter).
The following IMAP-specific commands exist:
.
.
.Bl -tag -width ".It Ic BaNg"
.Mx
.It Ic cache
Only applicable to cached IMAP mailboxes;
takes a message list and reads the specified messages into the IMAP
cache.
.
.Mx
.It Ic connect
If operating in disconnected mode on an IMAP mailbox,
switch to online mode and connect to the mail server while retaining
the mailbox status.
See the description of the
.Va disconnected
variable for more information.
.
.Mx
.It Ic disconnect
If operating in online mode on an IMAP mailbox,
switch to disconnected mode while retaining the mailbox status.
See the description of the
.Va disconnected
variable for more.
A list of messages may optionally be given as argument;
the respective messages are then read into the cache before the
connection is closed, thus
.Ql disco *
makes the entire mailbox available for disconnected use.
.
.Mx
.It Ic imap
Sends command strings directly to the current IMAP server.
\*(UA operates always in IMAP `selected state' on the current mailbox;
commands that change this will produce undesirable results and should be
avoided.
Useful IMAP commands are:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width ".Ic getquotearoot"
.It create
Takes the name of an IMAP mailbox as an argument and creates it.
.It getquotaroot
(RFC 2087) Takes the name of an IMAP mailbox as an argument
and prints the quotas that apply to the mailbox.
Not all IMAP servers support this command.
.It namespace
(RFC 2342) Takes no arguments and prints the Personal Namespaces,
the Other User's Namespaces and the Shared Namespaces.
Each namespace type is printed in parentheses;
if there are multiple namespaces of the same type,
inner parentheses separate them.
For each namespace a prefix and a hierarchy separator is listed.
Not all IMAP servers support this command.
.El
.
.Mx
.It Ic imapcodec
Perform IMAP path transformations.

.Cm vput

.Va \&! .
The first argument specifies the operation:
.Ar e[ncode]
normalizes hierarchy delimiters (see
.Va imap-delim )
and converts the strings from the locale
.Va ttycharset
to the internationalized variant used by IMAP,
.Ar d[ecode]
performs the reverse operation.
.El

.
.Pp
The following IMAP-specific internal variables exist:
.
.
.Bl -tag -width ".It Va BaNg"
.Mx
.It Va disconnected
\*(BO When an IMAP mailbox is selected and this variable is set,
no connection to the server is initiated.
Instead, data is obtained from the local cache (see
.Va imap-cache Ns
).
Mailboxes that are not present in the cache
and messages that have not yet entirely been fetched from the server
are not available;
to fetch all messages in a mailbox at once,
the command
.No ` Ns Li copy * /dev/null Ns '
can be used while still in connected mode.
Changes that are made to IMAP mailboxes in disconnected mode are queued
and committed later when a connection to that server is made.
This procedure is not completely reliable since it cannot be guaranteed
that the IMAP unique identifiers (UIDs) on the server still match the
ones in the cache at that time.
Data is saved to

(the default),
`cram-md5', which is a password-based authentication that does not send
the password over the network in clear text,
and `gssapi' for GSS-API based authentication.
.
.Mx
.It Va imap-cache
Enables caching of IMAP mailboxes.
The value of this variable must point to a directory that is either
existent or can be created by \*(UA.
All contents of the cache can be deleted by \*(UA at any time;
it is not safe to make assumptions about them.
.
.Mx Va imap-delim
.It Va imap-delim-USER@HOST , imap-delim-HOST , imap-delim
The hierarchy separator used by the IMAP server.
Whenever an IMAP path is specified it will undergo normalization.
One of the normalization steps is the squeezing and adjustment of
hierarchy separators.
If this variable is set, any occurrence of any character of the given
value that exists in the path will be replaced by the first member of
the value; an empty value will cause the default to be used, it is
.Ql /. .
If not set, we will reuse the first hierarchy separator character that
is discovered in a user-given mailbox name.
.
.Mx Va imap-keepalive
.It Va imap-keepalive-USER@HOST , imap-keepalive-HOST , imap-keepalive
IMAP servers may close the connection after a period of
inactivity; the standard requires this to be at least 30 minutes,
but practical experience may vary.
Setting this variable to a numeric `value' greater than 0 causes
a `NOOP' command to be sent each `value' seconds if no other operation
is performed.
.
.Mx
.It Va imap-list-depth
When retrieving the list of folders on an IMAP server, the
.Ic folders
command stops after it has reached a certain depth to avoid possible
infinite loops.
The value of this variable sets the maximum depth allowed.
The default is 2.
If the folder separator on the current IMAP server is a slash `/',
this variable has no effect and the
.Ic folders
command does not descend to subfolders.
.
.Mx Va imap-use-starttls
.It Va imap-use-starttls-USER@HOST , imap-use-starttls-HOST , imap-use-starttls
Causes \*(UA to issue a `STARTTLS' command to make an unencrypted
IMAP session TLS encrypted.
This functionality is not supported by all servers,
and is not used if the session is already encrypted by the IMAPS method.

M. Douglas McIlroy writes in his article
.Dq A Research UNIX Reader: Annotated Excerpts \
from the Programmer's Manual, 1971-1986
that a
.Xr mail 1
command already appeared in First Edition
.Ux
in 1971:
.
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Electronic mail was there from the start.
Never satisfied with its exact behavior, everybody touched it at one
time or another: to assure the safety of simultaneous access, to improve
privacy, to survive crashes, to exploit uucp, to screen out foreign
freeloaders, or whatever.
Not until v7 did the interface change (Thompson).
Later, as mail became global in its reach, Dave Presotto took charge and
brought order to communications with a grab-bag of external networks
(v8).

Mail was written in 1978 by Kurt Shoens and developed as part of the
.Bx
.Ux
distribution until 1995.
Mail has then seen further development in open source
.Bx
variants, noticeably by Christos Zoulas in
.Pf Net Bx .
Based upon this Nail, later Heirloom Mailx, was developed by Gunnar
Ritter in the years 2000 until 2008.
Since 2012 S-nail is maintained by Steffen (Daode) Nurpmeso.
This man page is derived from
.Dq The Mail Reference Manual
that was originally written by Kurt Shoens.

.
\*(ID Interrupting an operation via
.Dv \&\&SIGINT
aka
.Ql control-C
from anywhere else but a command prompt is very problematic and likely
to leave the program in an undefined state: many library functions
cannot deal with the
.Fn siglongjmp 3
that this software (still) performs; even though efforts have been taken
to address this, no sooner but in v15 it will have been worked out:
interruptions have not been disabled in order to allow forceful breakage
of hanging network connections, for example (all this is unrelated to
.Va ignore ) .
.
.Pp
The SMTP and POP3 protocol support of \*(UA is very basic.
Also, if it fails to contact its upstream SMTP server, it will not make
further attempts to transfer the message at a later time (setting
.Va save
and
.Va sendwait
may be useful).
If this is a concern, it might be better to set up a local SMTP server
that is capable of message queuing.

After deleting some message of a POP3 mailbox the header summary falsely
claims that there are no messages to display, one needs to perform
a scroll or dot movement to restore proper state.
